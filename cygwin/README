Building sqsh on Windows in the Cygwin environment

Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) is a free Unix-like environment (complete
with X Window server, bash, etc.) that you can install on Windows
machines. sqsh and other Unix tools can be built in that environment
and then used to access resources/servers/etc as if you were using a
Windows program.

Building sqsh in the Cygwin environment requires a couple of
non-standard operations both because the configure script
hasn't been adapted for Cygwin, and because sqsh can't use the
Sybase DLLs directly.

1. Generating the appropriate libXXX.a files
   The cygwin.sh script in this directory can be used to generate
   these files (libblk.a, libcs.a and libct.a). HOWEVER - this script
   does not generate usable files with recent (12.5.1 and later)
   versions of OCS. This directory includes copies of these "libraries"
   that you should be able to use. Note that these .a files aren't
   real libraries - they just document the entry points to the DLLs.

2. config.h
   This file is normally generated by the configure script. You can
   either use the one provided (which should work), or run configure
   yourself to generate this file.

3. Makefile
   The Makefile in this directory has been tailored for use with
   Cygwin. To use this file directly you need to update the
   SYBASE_OCOS macro (near the top of the file) to point at your 
   OpenClient installation - it defaults to c:/sybase/OCS-12_5/
   The SYBASE_LIBS macro points at the .a files in this directory,
   and the CPPFLAGS include the extra defines
   (-D_MSC_VER=800 -D_CYGWIN32_) that are needed to build sqsh in
   this environment.

Building:

1. Copy config.h to ../src
2. cd ../src
3. Run "make -f ../cygwin/Makefile"

You should normally now have a sqsh.exe binary in the src directory.
