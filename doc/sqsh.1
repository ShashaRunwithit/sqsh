.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Sqsh  (pronounced  skwish) is short for SQshelL (pronounced s\-q\-shell),
and is intended as a replacement for the venerable ‘isql’ program supplied
by  Sybase.  It came about due to years of frustration of trying
to do real work with a program that was never meant to perform real work.
.PP
Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt, it is intended to provide much of
the functionality provided by a good shell, such as variables, aliasing,
redirection, pipes, back\-grounding, job control, history, command
substitution, and dynamic configuration.  Also, as a by-product of the
design, it is remarkably easy to extend and add functionality.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The following options may be used to adjust some of the behavior of
sqsh, however a large portion of the configuration options are available
only through environment variables which may be set at runtime or via a
\&.sqshrc file.
.PP
Options may also be supplied in the \s-1SQSH\s0 environment  variable. This
variable is parsed prior to parsing the command line, so in most cases
the command line will override the contents of the variable. Be aware
that  for options which are allowed to supplied multiple times, such as
\&\fB\-c\fR, supplying them both in a variable and on the command line will be
the same as supplying them multiple times on the command line.
.IP "\-a count" 4
.IX Item "-a count"
Sets the maximum \fIcount\fR of failures (as determined by the \f(CW$thresh_fail\fR variable) 
that may occur before  sqsh  will abort. Setting this to 0 indicates that sqsh should not
exit on errors. This value defaults to 0 and may also
be  set  using  the  \f(CW$thresh_exit\fR variable.  See section \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR for details.
.IP "\-A packetsize" 4
.IX Item "-A packetsize"
Specifies the size of the network \s-1TDS\s0 packets used to communicate with the \s-1SQL\s0 server. This value must be
between 512 and 8192, and be a multiple  of  512. Check
your  \s-1SQL\s0  Server  configuration  to determine supported
packet sizes.  This value may also be specified at  run-time using the \f(CW$packet_size\fR variable.
.IP "\-b" 4
.IX Item "-b"
Suppress the banner message upon startup. This is unnecessary in cases where stdout has been  redirected  to  a
file.  This option may also be set via the \f(CW$banner\fR variable.
.IP "\-B" 4
.IX Item "-B"
Turns off all buffering of stdin,  stdout,  and  stderr.
This  feature  allows sqsh to be run from an interactive
control script such as chat and expect.
.IP "\-c [cmdend]" 4
.IX Item "-c [cmdend]"
Internally sqsh provides the command \fB\ego\fR to send a batch
of  \s-1SQL\s0  to the database and provides a single alias, \fBgo\fR
for this command.  Each time \fIcmdend\fR is  supplied  a  new
alias for \fB\ego\fR is established.
.IP "\-C sql" 4
.IX Item "-C sql"
Causes  the  \fIsql\fR command to be executed by sqsh, similar
to the same behavior exhibited by the \-i flag.  This \fIsql\fR
statment  may not contain double quotes (this limitation
may be lifted in a future release of sqsh).
.IP "\-d severity" 4
.IX Item "-d severity"
Sets the minimum \s-1SQL\s0 Server error severity that will  be
displayed  to  the  user.   The  default is 0, and valid
ranges are from 0 to 22.  This may also be set using the
\&\f(CW$thresh_display\fR variable. See section \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR.
.IP "\-D database" 4
.IX Item "-D database"
Causes  sqsh to attempt to start with your database context set to 
\&\fIdatabase\fR rather than your  default  database
(usually  master).   This  may  also  be  set  using the
\&\f(CW$database\fR variable.
.IP "\-e" 4
.IX Item "-e"
Includes each command issued to sqsh to be  included  in
the  output.   This option may also be set via the \f(CW$echo\fR
variable (which is unrelated to the \fB\eecho\fR command).
.IP "\-E editor" 4
.IX Item "-E editor"
Set the default editor to \fIeditor\fR.  This may also be  set
using  the \s-1UNIX\s0 environment variable \f(CW$EDITOR\fR to the name
of the editor desired.
.IP "\-f severity" 4
.IX Item "-f severity"
Sets the minimum \fIseverity\fR level considered a failure  by
sqsh.   This  is  the  same  as setting the \f(CW$thresh_fail\fR
variable.  See section \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR for details.
.IP "\-h" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Turns  off  column  headers and trailing  \*(L"(# rows affected)\*(R" from batch output.
.IP "\-i filename" 4
.IX Item "-i filename"
Read all input from \fIfilename\fR rather than from stdin.
.IP "\-H hostname" 4
.IX Item "-H hostname"
Sets the client  hostname as reported in sysprocesses.
This may also be set via the \f(CW$hostname\fR variable.
.IP "\-I interfaces" 4
.IX Item "-I interfaces"
When a connection is established to  the  database,  the
\&\fIinterfaces\fR  file  is  used to turn the value of \f(CW$DSQUERY\fR
into the hostname and port to which the connection  will
be  made,  by  default this is located in \f(CW$SYBASE\fR/interfaces.
This flag allows this default to be  overridden.
.IP "\-J charset" 4
.IX Item "-J charset"
Specifies  the  character  set  to be used on the client
side to communicate with \s-1SQL\s0 Server.  This may  also  be
set using the \f(CW$charset\fR environment variable.
.IP "\-k keywords" 4
.IX Item "-k keywords"
Specifies  a  file  containing  a list of keywords to be
used for keyword tab completion, if readline support has
been  compiled into sqsh.  This file may also be set via
the   \f(CW$keyword_file\fR   variable,   which   defaults    to
\&\f(CW$HOME\fR/.sqsh_words.
.IP "\-K keytab" 4
.IX Item "-K keytab"
Kerberos support. Specify the keytab file name for \s-1DCE\s0.
.Sp
See the Kerberos Support section below for details.
.IP "\-l debug_flags" 4
.IX Item "-l debug_flags"
If sqsh has been compiled with \-DDEBUG, this option may
be used to turn on and off debugging options.   See  the
\&\f(CW$debug\fR variable, below.
.IP "\-L var=value" 4
.IX Item "-L var=value"
Sets  the  value  of \f(CW$var\fR to \fIvalue\fR.  This may be used to
set the value of any sqsh variable even if  an  explicit
command  line variable is supplied for setting the variable.  
The \fB\-L\fR flag may be used to set the value of  non-configuration variables as well.
.IP "\-m style" 4
.IX Item "-m style"
Changes  the  current display style to \fIstyle\fR.  Currently
supported styles  are  \fBhoriz\fR,  \fBvert\fR,  \fBbcp\fR,  \fBhtml\fR,  \fBmeta\fR,
\&\fBpretty\fR  and  \fBnone\fR. The current display style may also be
set using the \f(CW$style\fR variable or via the \fB\-m\fR flag to  the
\&\fB\ego\fR command.
.IP "\-n on|off" 4
.IX Item "-n on|off"
Enables  chained  transaction mode on connect (if set to
on). Chained transaction mode is also known as \*(L"AutoCommit off\*(R" mode.
.IP "\-o filename" 4
.IX Item "-o filename"
Redirects all output to \fIfilename\fR rather than stdout.
.IP "\-p" 4
.IX Item "-p"
Display  performance statistics upon completion of every
\&\s-1SQL\s0 batch.  This option may also be turned  on  via  the
\&\f(CW$statistics\fR variable, or by supplying the \fB\-p\fR flag to the
\&\fB\ego\fR command.
.IP "\-P [password]" 4
.IX Item "-P [password]"
The Sybase \fIpassword\fR for \fIusername\fR required to connect  to
\&\fIserver\fR  (default,  \s-1NULL\s0).   The \fIpassword\fR may also be set
via \f(CW$password\fR. Supplying a password of  ‘\-’  causes  the
password to be read from the first line of stdin.
.Sp
sqsh takes pains to hide the password from any user trying to view the command line
used to launch sqsh, so using \fB\-P\fR should not constitute a security hole.
Alternatively, you can store your default password in .sqshrc file which is not readable by anyone
other than yourself.
.IP "\-Q value" 4
.IX Item "-Q value"
Query timeout value (equivalent to isql's \-t option). If set, will timeout a 
long running query. Maps to the \fB$query_timeout\fR variable.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&   sqsh -SASE1502 -Usa -P -Q30
\&   ASE1502.sa.master.1> cd tix
\&   ASE1502.sa.tix.1> select count(*) from E_TIX;
\&   Open Client Message
\&   Layer 1, Origin 2, Severity 2, Number 63
\&   ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.
\&   ASE1502: Query or command timeout detected, command/batch cancelled
\&   ASE1502: The client connection has detected this 1 time(s).
.Ve
.Sp
See also the \fB$max_timeout\fR variable, which controls the number of times a timeout 
needs to be retried before the query is aborted.
.IP "\-r [sqshrc]" 4
.IX Item "-r [sqshrc]"
Specifies an alternate \fI.sqshrc\fR  file  to  be  processed,
rather  than the default.  If no \fIsqshrc\fR is supplied following \fB\-r\fR, then no initialization files  are  processed.
This  flag  \fBmust\fR  be  the first argument supplied on the
command line, all other instances will be ignored.
.IP "\-R server_principal" 4
.IX Item "-R server_principal"
Kerberos support: Specifies a \fIserver principal\fR to use  for  network  (kerberos) authentication, if
the servername in the interfaces file differs from the real servername. 
.Sp
See the Kerberos Support section below for details.
.IP "\-s colsep" 4
.IX Item "-s colsep"
Causes the string \fIcolsep\fR to be used to delimit \s-1SQL\s0  column output columns, this defaults to \*(L" \*(R".
.IP "\-S server" 4
.IX Item "-S server"
The name of the Sybase \fIserver\fR to connect, the default of
this is  the  external  environment  variable  \f(CW$DSQUERY\fR. If neither \fB\-S\fR nor \f(CW$DSQUERY\fR is set then defaults to \*(L"\s-1SYBASE\s0\*(R".
This  value  may  also  be set via the internal variable
\&\f(CW$DSQUERY\fR.
.IP "\-t [filter]" 4
.IX Item "-t [filter]"
Enables filtering of command batches through an external
program,  \fIfilter\fR, prior to being sent to the \s-1SQL\s0 Server.
If \fIfilter\fR is not supplied,  then  \f(CW$filter_prog\fR  is  used
(default  is ‘m4 \-’). This value may also be set via the
\&\f(CW$filter\fR and \f(CW$filter_prog\fR variables.
.IP "\-T value" 4
.IX Item "-T value"
Specifies the login timeout (similar to isql's \-l flag). If set
specifies the number of seconds \fIsqsh\fR will wait before timing out a
login request. Maps to the \fB$login_timeout\fR variable.
.IP "\-U username" 4
.IX Item "-U username"
The Sybase \fIusername\fR to connect to the database as,  this
defaults  to the username of the user running \fIsqsh\fR.  The
\&\fIusername\fR may also be set via the \f(CW$username\fR variable.
.IP "\-v" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Displays the version number, \f(CW$version\fR,, and exits.
.IP "\-V [cimork]" 4
.IX Item "-V [cimork]"
Kerberos support: Specify the security options to use.
.Sp
See the Kerberos Support section below for details.
.IP "\-w width" 4
.IX Item "-w width"
The maximum output \fIwidth\fR of a displayed result set, this
defaults to 80.
.IP "\-X" 4
.IX Item "-X"
Initiates  the  login  connection  to  the  server  with
client-side  password  encryption  (if  supported).   If
either  \s-1SQL\s0 Server does not recognize this option, or if
the version of CT-Lib used to compile \fIsqsh\fR does not support  this  option, then it will be ignored. This option
may also be set using the \f(CW$encryption\fR environment  variable.
.IP "\-y directory" 4
.IX Item "-y directory"
Specifies a \s-1SYBASE\s0 \fIdirectory\fR to use other than the value
of \f(CW$SYBASE\fR in order to find the interfaces file.
.IP "\-z language" 4
.IX Item "-z language"
Specifies an alternate \fIlanguage\fR to display sqsh  prompts
and messages.  Without the \fB\-z\fR flag, the server’s default
language will be used.  This may also be set using  with
the \f(CW$language\fR variable.
.IP "\-Z [secmech]" 4
.IX Item "-Z [secmech]"
Kerberos support: Specify the security mechanism to use.
.Sp
See the Kerberos Support section below for details. 
.IP "args..." 4
.IX Item "args..."
If sqsh is run with the \fB\-i\fR flag specifying an input file
to be processed (rather then initiating  an  interactive
session),  arguments may be supplied on the command line
to be passed to the input file.  These arguments may  be
accessed  using  the variables ${0}, ${1}, ...  (see the
\&\fBVariables\fR section, below, for more information).
.Sh "\s-1INITIALIZATION\s0"
.IX Subsection "INITIALIZATION"
Upon startup, sqsh initializes all internal environment variables, commands,
and  aliases to their default values, it then looks in the system-wide configuration file (usually  /usr/local/etc/sqshrc),  followed
by a local configuration file \f(CW$HOME\fR/.sqshrc (this may be overridden via
the \s-1SQSHRC\s0 external environment variable).  If this file is found it is
executed just like a script would be using the \fB\-i\fR flag.
.PP
The  \fI.sqshrc\fR  file may contain anything that could normally be typed at
the prompt, however it should be noted that at the time  this  file  is
read  sqsh  has  yet to establish a connection to the database, however
most commands that perform database activity, such as \fB\ego\fR will  attempt
to  establish  a  database connection when executed (it may also prompt
you for a password  if  necessary).   Also,  if  database  activity  is
required  within this startup file, the \fB\econnect\fR command (see \fB\s-1COMMANDS\s0\fR,
below) may be executed.
.PP
After the \fI.sqshrc\fR file has been executed, \fIsqsh\fR then parses any  command
line  options (thus any variables set in your \fI.sqshrc\fR file may be overridden 
by command line options). Following that,  if  \fIsqsh\fR  is  run  in
interactive  mode  (i.e. without \fB\-i\fR and if stdin is attached to a tty),
it then looks for \fI.sqsh_history\fR and loads the  contents  of  that  file
into this history buffer (see \fB\s-1BUFFERS\s0\fR, below).
.PP
Immediately  prior to establishing a connection to the database (either
during startup, or by an explicit \fB\econnect\fR or \fB\ereconnect\fR command),  the
file  \f(CW$HOME\fR/.sqsh_session  is  executed.   The name of this file may be
overridden using the \f(CW$session\fR variable.
.Sh "COMMAND LINE"
.IX Subsection "COMMAND LINE"
When a line is first read by \fIsqsh\fR, the first word is separated from the
line.   This  word is then expanded of all variables (see \fBVariable Substitution\fR, below), 
followed by command expansion (see \fBCommand Substitution\fR,  below).  The first word of the resulting string is then analyzed
to see if it is either a valid \fIsqsh\fR command or alias.
.PP
The \fIsqsh\fR command line follows many of the same rules as  Bourne  shell,
allowing  file redirection, pipelining, command substitution, and back\-
grounding via the same syntax.
.Sh "Comments"
.IX Subsection "Comments"
Any line beginning with a \fB#\fR followed by a  non-alphanumeric  character
(any  character other than 0\-9, a\-z, A\-Z, and _) causes the entire line
to be ignored.  Because of the possible collision with \s-1TSQL\s0  temp-table
names,  the  line  will not be ignored if the first character following
the \fB#\fR, is alphanumeric.
.Sh "Quoting"
.IX Subsection "Quoting"
Quoting is used to prevent the interpretation of  special  keywords  or
characters to sqsh, such as white\-space, variable expansion, or command
substitution.  There are three types of quoting, \fIescape\fR, \fIsingle-quotes\fR,
and \fIdouble-quotes\fR.
.PP
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal interpretation 
of each character contained within the quotes.  A single quote may
not  appear  within single quotes, even when preceded by an escape. For
example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1> \eecho I can not expand '$username'
.Ve
.PP
outputs
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    I can not expand $username
.Ve
.PP
The characters \e\e are used to escape the meaning (and thus prevent  the
interpretation)  of  the  character  immediately following them.  The \e
character itself may be escaped. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1> \eecho I can\e\e't expand '$username'
.Ve
.PP
outputs
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    I can't expand $username
.Ve
.PP
The escape character may also be used to escape a new-line in order  to
perform a line continuation, in this case the new-line is discarded and
the continued line is automatically appended to the previous line,  for
example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    1> \eecho Hello \e\e
\&    --> World!
\&    Hello World!
.Ve
.PP
Enclosing  characters in double quotes preserves the literal meaning of
all characters within them with the exception of \fB$\fR, \fB‘\fR, and \fB\e\e\fR.  A  double quote 
may be contained within double quotes by escaping it.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1> \eecho "\e\eI can't deny it, I like $username\e\e", she said"
.Ve
.PP
prints out
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    "I can't deny it, I like gray", she said
.Ve
.Sh "Expansion"
.IX Subsection "Expansion"
After  a  line of input has been read, \fIsqsh\fR attempts to expand the line
of any aliases (see \fBAliasing\fR, below), following  that  it  attempts  to
determine  if  the line begins with a command keyword.  Once a line has
been determined to contain a command name it has two types of expansion
performed  up  it: \fIvariable substitution\fR, followed by \fIcommand substitution\fR respectively.  
Following this expansion the command line is  separated into words and the command is executed.
.Sh "Variable Substitution"
.IX Subsection "Variable Substitution"
The  character $ is used to indicate variable substitution or expansion
within a word. These variables may be assigned values by the \fB\eset\fR  command like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1> \eset name=value
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIname\fR  may  be  a character or underscore followed by any combination of
characters, digits, or underscore, and  may  not  contain  any  special
characters,  such as (’) and (").  The restriction on the first charac\-
ter being a digit is introduced because \s-1SQL\s0 allows  the  representation
of money datatypes as \f(CW$nn\fR.nn where n is a digit.
.PP
\&\fIvalue\fR  may  contain  anything, however if it is to include white\-space,
then it must be quoted (see \fBWords &  Quoting\fR,  above).   Note  that  in
order  to prevent the expansion of a variable use either single quotes,
or two \e’s, like thus:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> \eecho \e\e$name
\&    $name
.Ve
.PP
Variables may be referenced in one of two ways:
.PP
$variable      In this manner all characters, digits,  and  underscores
are  treated  as  the \fIname\fR of the variable until another
type of character is reached (either a  special  character, or a white\-space).
${variable}    The  braces  are required only when \fIvariable\fR is followed
by a letter, digit, or underscore  that  is  not  to  be
interpreted  as  part  of  its name.  Note that the same
effect may be achieved using double quotes.
.PP
It should be noted that because the variables  are  expanded  prior  to
breaking  the  command line into words, if the contents of the variable
contain white spaces, they are treated as significant  by  the  parser.
In the following example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> \eset x="1 2 3"
\&    1> \eecho $x
.Ve
.PP
the \fB\eecho\fR command receives three arguments, \*(L"1\*(R", \*(L"2\*(R", and \*(L"3\*(R", although
it looks as if only one argument was passed to it.   This  behavior  is
consistent with most shells (such as csh, bourne shell, etc.).
.Sh "Command Substitution"
.IX Subsection "Command Substitution"
\&\fISqsh\fR  supports  a second form of expansion called \fIcommand substitution\fR.
This this form of expansion the output of an external \s-1UNIX\s0 command  may
be  substituted  on the command line. This expansion may be achieved by
placing the command line to be executed in back-quotes (`).  For  example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    1> \eset password=`/sybase/bin/getpwd $DSQUERY`
\&    1> \eecho $password
\&    ilikepickles
.Ve
.PP
This  this example, the external program \fB/sybase/bin/getpwd\fR is executed
with the current contents of the  \f(CW$DSQUERY\fR  environment  variable,  the
entire   expression   is  then  replaced  with  the  output  of  \fBgetpwd (ilikepickles)\fR prior to executing the \fB\eset\fR command.
By default, the output of the substituted command is first broken  into
words  according  to  the contents of the \f(CW$ifs\fR variable prior to assembling together 
back into the command line. So, by overriding  the  contents  of \f(CW$ifs\fR you may affect the behavior of the substitution process.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    1> \eset ifs=":"
\&    1> \eecho `echo hello:how:are:you`
\&    hello how are you
.Ve
.PP
This mechanism is frequently useful for parsing input  files,  such  as
\&\fB/etc/passwd\fR into fields.
.Sh "Input/Output Redirection"
.IX Subsection "Input/Output Redirection"
As with standard Bourne shell (and most other shells, for that matter),
a command’s input and output may be redirected using a special notation
interpreted by the shell. The following may appear anywhere on the com\-
mand line, but only redirection that is specified \fIprior\fR to a  pipe  (|)
actually  has  any  effect  on  the  behavior of internal sqsh commands
(refer to \fBPipes\fR, below).
.IP "<word" 4
.IX Item "<word"
Use the file \fIword\fR as the standard input for the command.
Typically  very few \fIsqsh\fR commands actually read anything
from stdin, so this will usually have no effect (see the
\&\fB\eloop\fR command).
.IP "[n]>word" 4
.IX Item "[n]>word"
Associate  the  output  of file descriptor \fIn\fR (stdout, by
default) with file \fIword\fR. If this file does not exist  it
is created; otherwise it is truncated to zero length.
.IP "[n]>>word" 4
.IX Item "[n]>>word"
Append  the  the output of file descriptor \fIn\fR (stdout, by
default) to file \fIword\fR, creating it if it does not exist.
.IP "[m]>&n" 4
.IX Item "[m]>&n"
Redirect  the  output  of  file  descriptor \fIm\fR (stdout by
default), to same output as file descriptor \fIn\fR.
The order in which redirections are specified on the  command  line  is
significant, as the redirections are evaluated left\-to\-right. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    1> select * from select /* syntax error */
\&    2> \ego >/tmp/output 2>&1
.Ve
.Sp
This statement first redirects the standard output of the  \fB\ego\fR  command
to  the  file  \fI/tmp/output\fR, then redirects the stderr to the same file.
So, when the commands fails, the error output will be found in the file
\&\fI/tmp/output\fR.
.Sp
However,  by  changing  the  order  of  redirection, you can completely
change the meaning:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    1> select * from select
\&    2> \ego 2>&1 >/tmp/output
\&    Msg 156, Level 15, State 1
\&    Server 'SQSH_TEST', Line 1
\&    Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'select'.
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, error output will be sent to  stdout,  while  what  would
have  gone  to  stdout  is  redirected  to  \fI/tmp/output\fR  (in  this case
\&\fI/tmp/output\fR will be empty).
.PP
Please read the section on \fBBackground Jobs\fR, below, for detailed info on
the interaction between file redirection and background jobs.
.Sh "Pipes"
.IX Subsection "Pipes"
A  \fIpipeline\fR  is  a sequence of one or more commands separated by a ‘|’,
each command using the stdout of the  preceding  program  for  its  own
stdin.   However  the first command in the i<pipeline> must be a sqsh command, 
and all other commands must be external (or \s-1UNIX\s0) programs.   Any
sqsh  command  may be run through a pipeline, although for many of them
(such as the \fB\eset\fR command) it doesn’t really make any sense to do this.
The following is an example of a \fIpipeline\fR:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select * from syslogins
\&    2> \ego | more
.Ve
.PP
This  command  causes the result set generated by the \fB\ego\fR command to be
sent to the \fB\f(BImore\fB\|(1)\fR program, which then sends it to your screen,  pausing 
at  each  screen  full  of data (this is the primary reason that I
wrote sqsh).
.PP
There are several peculiarities in the way in  which  sqsh  deals  with
\&\fIpipelines\fR  as  opposed to the way in which standard Bourne shell treats
them.
.PP
Everything following the first occurrence of a pipe  (|)  character  is
broken  into  white-space delimited words, including such special shell
commands as ‘2>&1’ and other occurrences of pipes.  If  there  are  any
variables contained in these words they are expanded following the same
quoting rules as described in \fBWords &  Quoting\fR,  above,  with  the  one
exception  that all quotes are left in place.  These words are then reassembled 
into a single string and shipped off to /bin/sh for  processing.
.PP
In  short,  sqsh  makes  no attempt to interpret what follows the first
pipe, instead it is shipped off to a \*(L"real\*(R" shell to do the work.   The
rationale  behind  this is that I was lazy and didn’t feel like writing
all of the same bizarre variable handling,  &&’ing,  ||’ing,  grouping,
and  variable expansion rules that Bourne shell supports, and instead I
let Bourne do the dirty work.
.PP
The advantage of this method is that you can do some very complex stuff
after the pipeline, such as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select * from syscolumns
\&    2> \ego | (cd /tmp; compress -c > sysolumns.Z)
.Ve
.PP
Not that I can think of any real reason to do this...but you can if you
want to.
.Sh "Background Jobs"
.IX Subsection "Background Jobs"
Backgrounding provides a mechanism whereby you may run any sqsh command
as  a  background  process  and  continue  working while it runs.  Sqsh
offers two types of backgrounding:
.IP "Deferred" 4
.IX Item "Deferred"
In this mode sqsh redirects all output of the background
job  to  a  temporary  file  (located  in  the directory
\&\f(CW$tmp_dir\fR) while the job is running, so that  the  output
is  not  intermixed  with what you are currently working
on.  When the job completes you are notified of the pro\-
cess  completion  and the output may be viewed using the
\&\fB\eshow\fR command.
.IP "Non-Deferred" 4
.IX Item "Non-Deferred"
This corresponds to the common idea of a background process  
under \s-1UNIX\s0.  In this mode the output of the job is
not implicitly redirected for you, and thus  may  become
intermingled with what you are currently working.
The  mode selection you choose is selectable via the \f(CW$defer_bg\fR variable
(which defaults to ‘1’, or ‘On’).  Typically the only reason to not use
\&\fIdeferred\fR mode is to prevent large result sets from filling up your file
system.
.PP
To specify that a job be run in the background, simply append  a  &  to
the end of the command line, as:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    1> sp_long_arduous_proc 1, 30
\&    2> \ego &
\&    Job #1 running [xxxx]
\&    1>
.Ve
.PP
When  sqsh  encounters the & on the end of the command line it spawns a
child process (with a Unix process id of \fIxxxx\fR) then the  child  process
calls  the  \fB\ego\fR.  \fB\ego\fR command then establishes a new connection to the
database (using the current values of the \f(CW$DSQUERY\fR, \f(CW$username\fR, \f(CW$password\fR variables) and executes the shown query.
While  the  job  is executing the commands \fB\ejobs\fR \fB\ewait\fR and \fB\ekill\fR may be
used to monitor or alter a currently running  jobs  (see  section  \fB\s-1COMMANDS\s0\fR,  below).   
When  any jobs complete sqsh will display a notification, such as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    1> select count(*) from <return>
\&    Job #1 complete (output pending)
\&    2>
.Ve
.PP
When a job completes, if it had no output, it is immediately considered
terminated  and  will  not show up in the current list of running jobs.
However if the complete job has pending output, it will continue to  be
displayed  as  a  running job (with the \fB\ejobs\fR command) until a \fB\eshow\fR is
used to display the output of the job.
.PP
There is a known bug with job backgrounding when  used  in  conjunction
with  pipes, please refer to the \fB\s-1BUGS\s0\fR section at the end of the manual.
.Sh "\s-1BUFFERS\s0"
.IX Subsection "BUFFERS"
In normal \fBisql\fR only two buffers are maintained; the buffer into  which
you  are  currently  typing,  and a buffer that contains the last batch
executed (this is kept around for when you run ‘vi’, or ‘edit’).
.PP
Sqsh maintains several distinct sets of buffers:
.PP
\&\fBWork Buffer\fR: This  buffer  corresponds  directly  to  the  \fBisql\fR  work
buffer.   It is the buffer into which you enter the current batch prior to sending it to the database.
.PP
\&\fBHistory Buffer\fR: This is actually a chain of 0 or more  buffers  (configurable  
by the \f(CW$histsize\fR variable) of the last \f(CW$histsize\fR
batches  that  have  been  run.   This  buffer  is  only
maintained  when  sqsh  is run in interactive mode; that
is, batches executed using the \fB\-i\fR flag, or executed  via
redirection  from the \s-1UNIX\s0 prompt will not be maintained
in history (after all, they are already in a file  somewhere).
.PP
If  the  variable \f(CW$histsave\fR is True (see section \fB\s-1SPECIAL\s0 \s-1VARIABLES\s0\fR), and sqsh is in interactive  mode,  then  the
current history buffer is written to \f(CW$HOME\fR/.sqsh_history
when the you exit.  This file is  then  read  back  into
sqsh the next time it is started in interactive mode.
.PP
\&\fBNamed Buffers\fR:  At  any time during a session the \fBWork Buffer\fR, or any of
the \fBHistory Buffers\fR may by copied into  a  named  buffer
using  the  \fB\ebuf\-copy\fR  command  (see  section  \fB\s-1COMMANDS\s0\fR,
below).  These buffers are lost when you  exit  (however
you  may use the \fB\ebuf\-save\fR command to save named buffers
to a file).
.PP
\fIBuffer Short-Hand\fR
.IX Subsection "Buffer Short-Hand"
.PP
Many commands allow all of these buffers to be referenced in  a  short-hand  fashion,  
very similar to the way that \fB\f(BIcsh\fB\|(1)\fR references its commands history.  
Any of these shorthands may  by  used  for  any  \fIbuffer\fR
parameter described in the \fB\s-1COMMANDS\s0\fR section:
.IP "!." 4
The current work buffer.
.IP "!!" 4
The  last  command  executed  (note, this is not available in
non-interactive mode as it does not maintain a history).
.IP "!+" 4
The next available  history  entry.   This  is  a  write-only
buffer,  so  typically only applies to such commands as \fB\ebuf\-copy\fR.
.IP "!n" 4
.IX Item "!n"
Refers to history #n.  Each time an entry is written to  history 
it is assigned an increasing number from the last entry,
with this short-hand you may reference any given history.
.IP "!buf_name" 4
.IX Item "!buf_name"
Just for consistency this is supplied as a reference to named
buffer  \fIbuf_name\fR, however \fIbuf_name\fR without the leading ‘!’ is
also considered correct.
.IP "buf_name" 4
.IX Item "buf_name"
Refers to the named buffer \fIbuf_name\fR.
.PP
\fIVariables\fR
.IX Subsection "Variables"
.PP
Variables may also be contained within work buffers. Under  these  circumstances  
the variables remain unexpanded until the buffer is sent to
the database (via the \fB\ego\fR command), during which time they are expanded
and  replaced  within the buffer.  This behavior may be altered via the
\&\f(CW$expand\fR variable (see \fBSpecial Variables\fR, below).
.PP
The following is an example of using variables within a buffer:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    1> \eset table_name=syscolumns
\&    1> select count(*) from $table_name
\&    2> \ego
.Ve
.PP
This is the equivalent of performing the query:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select count(*) from syscolumns
\&    2> \ego
.Ve
.PP
directly.  Typically this feature is useful for reusing  large  complex
\&\fBwhere\fR clauses, or long column names.
.PP
Quoting  rules  apply  the  same  in  \s-1SQL\s0 buffers as they do in command
lines.  That is, any variables contained within double quotes  (")  are
expanded  and  variables  contained  within  single quotes (’) are left
untouched. Thus:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select "$username", '$username'
\&    2> \ego
.Ve
.PP
yields the results
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    ---- ---------
\&    gray $username
.Ve
.PP
\fICommand Substitution\fR
.IX Subsection "Command Substitution"
.PP
As with the command line, the output of \s-1UNIX\s0 commands may also be  substituted  
within  a  \s-1SQL\s0 buffer upon execution (once again, only if the
\&\f(CW$expand\fR variable is set to 1, or true).  In this circumstance the  command 
contained with backquotes (`) is replaced with its output prior to
forwarding the buffer to \s-1SQL\s0 server.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select count(*) from `echo syscolumns`
\&    2> \ego
.Ve
.PP
Causes the strings  ‘echo  syscolumns‘  to  be  replaced  by  the  word
\&\fIsyscolumns\fR prior to executing the command.  It should be noted that the
contents of the substituted command are only executed at  the  time  of
the \fB\ego\fR command, not when the line of \s-1SQL\s0 is input.
.Sh "FLOW-OF-CONTROL"
.IX Subsection "FLOW-OF-CONTROL"
New  with version 2.0 of sqsh, is the ability to perform basic flow-of-control and 
functions using the \fB\eif\fR, \fB\ewhile\fR, \fB\edo\fR, and \fB\efunc\fR commands.
.PP
\fIBlocks & \s-1SQL\s0 Buffers\fR
.IX Subsection "Blocks & SQL Buffers"
.PP
All sqsh flow-of-control commands are block\-based. That is, if the
test expression of the command is met, then a block of sqsh-script will
be executed.  For example, the definition of the \fB\eif\fR command is:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    \eif expression
\&        block
\&    \efi
.Ve
.PP
This \fIblock\fR may be any number of lines of sqsh commands, \s-1SQL\s0,  or  flow-of-control 
statements  to be executed if the \fIexpression\fR evaluates to a
success condition (0).
.PP
Each \fIblock\fR has its own \s-1SQL\s0 buffer for the duration that  the  \fIblock\fR  is
executed.  That is, the following statements:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    1> /*
\&    2> ** IMPROPER USAGE OF IF BLOCK
\&    3> */
\&    4> select count(*) from 
\&    5> \eif [ $x -gt 10 ]
\&    6>     sysobjects
\&    7> \eelse
\&    8>     sysindexes
\&    9> \efi
\&    5> go
.Ve
.PP
will yield:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    Msg 102, Level 15, State 1
\&    Server 'bps_pro', Line 1
\&    Incorrect syntax near 'from'
.Ve
.PP
because  the  string  ’sysobjects’  or  ’sysindexes’ were inserted into
their own \s-1SQL\s0 buffers. These buffers are discarded as soon as  the  end
of  the  block  was  reached, and since a \fB\ego\fR command was not contained
within the block, no additional errors were generated.
.PP
Thus, the correct way to write the above expression would be:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    1> /*
\&    2> ** PROPER USAGE OF IF BLOCK
\&    3> */
\&    4>  \eif [ $x -gt 10 ]
\&    5>     select count(*) from sysobjects
\&    6>     go
\&    7> \eelse
\&    8>     select count(*) from sysindexes
\&    9>     go
\&    10> \efi
.Ve
.PP
or, even:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    1> /*
\&    2> ** PROPER USAGE OF IF BLOCK
\&    3> */
\&    4>  \eif [ $x -gt 10 ]
\&    5>     \eset table_name=sysobjects
\&    6> \eelse
\&    7>     \eset table_name=sysinexes
\&    8> \efi
\&    4> select * from $table_name
\&    5> go
.Ve
.PP
Also, note that the line number displayed in the sqsh prompt resets  to
the  current  position  in  the outer \s-1SQL\s0 buffer after reaching the \fB\efi\fR
terminator.
.PP
\fIExpressions\fR
.IX Subsection "Expressions"
.PP
All flow-of-control statements in sqsh take an \fIexpression\fR to  determine
which  \fIblock\fR  of  code to execute.  Just like UNIX’s Bourne Shell, this
\&\fIexpression\fR is simply an operating system program that  is  executed  by
sqsh.  If the command returns a success status (calls \fIexit\fR\|(0)), then it
is considered successfull.
.PP
For example, with following statement:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    \ewhile test $x -lt 10
\&        block
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
will execute the contents of \fIblock\fR while the current  value  of  \f(CW$x\fR  is
less  than  10.  Note that ’test’ is a standard \s-1UNIX\s0 program to perform
basic string or numeric comparisons (among other things).  Also, unlike
many shells, sqsh has no built-in version of ’test’.
.PP
Sqsh does, however, support the standard short form of ’test’:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    \ewhile [ $x -lt 10 ]
\&        block
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
With  this  expression  the  open  brace  (’[’) is replaced by the sqsh
parser with ’test’, and the close brace (’]’) is discarded.
.PP
\fIUnsupported Expressions\fR
.IX Subsection "Unsupported Expressions"
.PP
Currently sqsh does not support the standard shell predicate  operators
’&&’ and ’||’.  These can be performed like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    \eif sh -c "cmd1 && cmd2"
\&        block
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
\eif statement
.IX Subsection "if statement"
.PP
The  \fB\eif\fR  command  performs conditional execution of a sqsh \fIblock\fR based
upon the outcome of a supplied expression:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    \eif expr1
\&        block1
\&    \eelif expr2
\&        block2
\&    \eelse
\&        block3
\&    \efi
.Ve
.PP
In this example, if expression \fIexpr1\fR evaluates to true, then the  block
\&\fIblock1\fR  is  evaluated.  Otherwise, if the expression \fIexpr2\fR evaluates to
true, then block \fIblock2\fR is evaluated. Finally, if all other tests  fail
\&\fIblock3\fR is evaluated.
.PP
Note  that,  unlike Bourne Shell, every \fB\eif\fR command must be accompanies
by a trailing \fB\efi\fR statement.  Also the  sqsh  parser  is  not  terribly
intelligent:  The \fB\eelse\fR and \fB\efi\fR statements must be the only contents on
the line in which they appear, and they may not be aliased  to  another
name.
.PP
\ewhile statement
.IX Subsection "while statement"
.PP
The  \fB\ewhile\fR  command executes a \fIblock\fR of sqsh code for the while a supplied expression remains true.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    \ewhile expr
\&        block
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
In this example, while the expression \fIexpr\fR evaluates to true, then  the
block \fIblock\fR is evaluated.
.PP
The  \fB\ebreak\fR statement may be used to break out of the inner-most \fB\ewhile\fR
or \fB\efor\fR loop (more on \fB\efor\fR below).
.PP
\efor statement
.IX Subsection "for statement"
.PP
The \fB\efor\fR command executes a \fIbloc\fRk of sqsh code for each \fIwor\fRd supplied:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    \efor var in word ...
\&        block
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
For each \fIword\fR supplied, the value of the variable \fB$var\fR is  set  to  the
word  and the \fIblock\fR of code is executed.  Execution ends when there are
no more words in the list.
.PP
As with \fB\ewhile\fR the \fB\ebreak\fR statement may be used to  break  out  of  the
inner-most execution loop.
.PP
\edo command
.IX Subsection "do command"
.PP
The  \fB\edo\fR  command is kind of a cross between a statement and a command.
.PP
It is a form of \fB\ego\fR (see below for details on the \fB\ego\fR command) in which
a \fIblock\fR of sqsh code may be executed for each row of data returned from
the query.  When the \fIblock\fR is executed, special sqsh variables  #[0\-9]+
(a  hash  followed  by a number) may be used to reference the values in
the returned query. For example the following command:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    select id, name from master..sysdatabases
\&    \edo
\&        \eecho "Checkpointing database #2, dbid #1"
\&        use #2
\&        go
\&        checkpoint
\&        go
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
would cause a \s-1CHECKPOINT\s0 command to be issued in each database  on  the
server.
.PP
Command line options
.IX Subsection "Command line options"
.PP
The  \fB\edo\fR  command  establishes  a new connection to be used by the
\&\fIblock\fR of code when  executed.   By  default,  this  connection  is
established   to  the  current  server  (the  current  setting  of
\&\fB$DSQUERY\fR), using the current username (\fB$username\fR) and the  current
password  (\fB$password\fR).   This behavior may, however, be overridden
using command line options:
.IP "\-U username" 4
.IX Item "-U username"
Establishes the connection to  the  server  as  the  supplied
\&\fIusername\fR.
.IP "\-P password" 4
.IX Item "-P password"
Establishes  the  connection to the server using the supplied
\&\fIpassword\fR (which is hopefully a valid password  for  the  supplied \fIusername\fR).
.IP "\-S server" 4
.IX Item "-S server"
Establishes the connection to the supplied \fIserver\fR.
.IP "\-n" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Do  not  create  a  connection for use by the \fB\edo\fR loop.  This
flag is mutually exclusive with the above  flags.  With  this
flag  enabled,  attempts  to perform database commands within
the \fIblock\fR will generate a flurry of CT-Library errors.
.PP
Column variables
.IX Subsection "Column variables"
.PP
As mentioned above, the values  of  the  columns  in  the  current
result  set may be determined using the special #[0\-9]+ variables.
Thus, the variable #1 would contain the value of column number one
of the current result set, and #122 could contain the value of the
122’nd column (column numbers begin at 1).
.PP
In the case of nested \fB\edo\fR loops, values in previous nesting levels
may  be  referred  to by simply appending an addition ‘#’ for each
previous nesting level, like so:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    select id, name from sysobjects
\&    \edo
\&        select name, indid from sysindexes where id = #1
\&        \edo
\&            \eecho "Table ##2 (objid ##1) has index #1"
\&        \edone
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
obviously, this isn’t the way you would  do  this  query  in  real
life, but you get the idea.
.PP
When  expanding columns with \s-1NULL\s0 values, the column variable will
expand to an empty string (‘’).  Also, references to  non-existant
columns, such as #0, will result in an empty string (‘’).
.PP
As with regular sqsh variables (those referenced with a ‘$’), col\-
umn variables will not be expanded when  contained  within  single
quotes.
.PP
Aborting
.IX Subsection "Aborting"
.PP
If the \fB\ebreak\fR or \fB\ereturn\fR commands are issued during the processing
of a \fB\edo\fR loop, the current query will be canceled, the  connection
used  by the loop will be closed (unless the \fB\-n\fR flag was supplied)
and the \fB\edo\fR loop will abort.
.PP
\efunc command
.IX Subsection "func command"
.PP
The \fB\efunc\fR command is used to define a reusable block of sqsh code as  a
function.  Functions are defined like so:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    \efunc stats
\&        \eif [ $# -ne 1 ]
\&            \eecho "use: stats [on | off]"
\&            \ereturn 1
\&        \efi
\&        set statistics io ${1}
\&        set statistics tim ${1}
\&        go
\&    \edone
.Ve
.PP
In this example a new function is established called \fIstats\fR that expects
a single argument, either \*(L"on\*(R" or \*(L"off\*(R".  Using  this  argument, \fIstats\fR
will enable or disable time-based and I/O\-based statistics.
.PP
Once established, the function may be called like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \ecall stats on
.Ve
.PP
Causing  all  instances  of  ${1} to be replaced with the first command
line argument to \fIstats\fR.
.PP
Command line options
.IX Subsection "Command line options"
.PP
Currently only one command line argument is available to the \fB\efunc\fR
command.
.IP "\-x" 4
.IX Item "-x"
Causes  the  function to be exported as a \fIsqsh\fR command.  That
is, the function may be invoked  directly  without  requiring
the \fB\ecall\fR command.  This behavior is optional because command
names can potentially conflict  with  T\-SQL  keywords.   When
using  this  flag  it is recommended that you prepend a backslash (\e) to your function name.
.PP
Function variables
.IX Subsection "Function variables"
.PP
As shown in the  example  above,  several  special  variables  are
available for use within the body of the function. These are:
.IP "$#" 4
Expands  to  the number of arguments supplied to the function
when invoked.
.IP "${0}..${N}" 4
.IX Item "${0}..${N}"
Expands to positional arguments to the function. ${0} is  the
name  of  the function being invoked, ${1} is the first argument, 
${2} the second and so\-on, up to argument \fI\s-1NN\s0\fR.
Note that, unlike most shells, sqsh  requires  that  function
arguments  be referred to using the special curley brace syn\-
tax (${1}, rather than \f(CW$1\fR). The reason for this is that \f(CW$1\fR is
a  valid  \s-1MONEY\s0 value and using the curely braces gets rid of
this ambiguity.
.IP "$?" 4
After the invokation of a function,  this  will  contain  its
return value (see below).
.PP
Return value
.IX Subsection "Return value"
.PP
A  value  may be returned from a function via the \fB\ereturn\fR command.
.PP
Like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \ereturn N
.Ve
.PP
Where \fIN\fR is a positive value.  This return value  is  available  to
the caller of the function via the \fB$?\fR  variable.  As convention, a
return value of 0 is used to indicate a success.
.PP
If \fB\ereturn\fR is not explicitly called, the default return  value  is
the  current  value  of  the  \fB$?\fR  variable (which is set to 0 upon
entry of the function).  Thus, if any \s-1SQL\s0 statements  are  invoked
within  the  function, the default return value of \fB$?\fR  will be the
last error code returned during the processing of the  \s-1SQL\s0  statement.
.Sh "Kerberos Support"
.IX Subsection "Kerberos Support"
Starting with 2.1.6 sqsh provides the same command line options
as isql to handle Kerberos network authentication.
.PP
In version 2.1.5 experimental Kerberos support was added using the \-K and \-R options. \-K was merely a switch
to set Kerberos on. In sqsh 2.1.6 a more advanced implementation of network authentication is introduced,
although still experimental.
.PP
By using the parameters \-K, \-R, \-V, \-Z you can make use of your defined network security settings. (libtcl.cfg).
The named options are identical to the ones defined for isql.
.IP "\-K keytab_file" 4
.IX Item "-K keytab_file"
keytab_file name for \s-1DCE\s0.
.IP "\-R server_principal" 4
.IX Item "-R server_principal"
server principal name when Servername specified in interfaces differs 
from the real servername
.IP "\-V" 4
.IX Item "-V"
Specify security options to use (cimorq)
.IP "\-Z" 4
.IX Item "-Z"
Requested security mechanism name defined for Kerberos, \s-1DCE\s0 or \s-1PAM\s0 in your libtcl.cfg file. 
.PP
For example, connecting to a remote server using Kerberos (which happens to be the default, i.e. first entry
in libtcl.cfg [\s-1SECURITY\s0] tab in this example):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   ~> sqsh -SLINUX1502 -Uuser1 -RFC6A1502 -Z
\&   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services();

information.
.PP
.Vb 12

\&   program_name
\&   ------------------------------
\&   sqsh-2.1.6
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  (1 row affected)
.Ve
.PP
Note that you can specify \-V and or \-Z without having to specify a value. Is the value empty for \-Z
or contains the value 'default' then the default will be used, which is the first active security driver
in the libtcl.cfg file.
.PP
When the connection succeeds, sqsh will store the real name of the security mechanism in the variable
secmech. For example: \*(L"\eecho \f(CW$secmech\fR\*(R" may show csfkrb5. The option \-V takes a list of characters from the
possible values of 'cimorq'. If you do not want to set a security service protocol then you have to specify
\&\-Vx for example. 'x' is not an existing option related to a security service and as a value is provided,
sqsh will not fall back to the default of all options. When \-V is empty however, then all possibly supported
security protocols for the selected secmech will be enabled. The key letters are:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   c -   Enable data confidentiality service
\&   i -   Enable data integrity service
\&   m -   Enable mutual authentication for connection establishment
\&   o -   Enable data origin stamping service
\&   q -   Enable out-of-sequence detection
\&   r -   Enable data replay detection
.Ve
.PP
If you specify \-V and/or \-Z, sqsh will assume network authentication is tried and no password is required.
.PP
If you have a network authenticated connection and want to \ereconnect using normal \s-1ASE\s0 authentication with
username and password, you have to reset the network authentication variables by specifying \-Znone
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&   [user1@linux-fc6a ~]$ sqsh -SFC6A1502 -Uuser1 -Z
\&   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> \eecho $secmech
\&   csfkrb5
\&   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> \ereconnect -SASE1502 -Usa -Psybase
\&   Open Client Message
\&   Layer 7, Origin 9, Severity 5, Number 8
\&   ct_connect(): security service layer: internal security control layer error:
\&   Consistency checks performed on the credential failed (minor status 0).
\&   FC6A1502.user1.master.1> \ereconnect -SASE1502 -Usa -Psybase -Znone
\&   ASE1502.sa.master.1>
.Ve
.PP
The first \ereconnect fails because sqsh still wants to try network authentication. However, no user principal
for 'sa' exists or no ticket is set and the connection fails. The second \ereconnect succeeds as the \-Znone
reset appropriate variables.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.Sh "Read-Eval-Print"
.IX Subsection "Read-Eval-Print"
The read-eval-print loop is the heart of the sqsh system and is responsible
for prompting a user for input and  determining  what  should  be
done  with  it.   Typically this loop is for internal use only, however
they are open to the user because there are some creative  things  that
can be done with them.
.IP "\eloop [\-i] [\-n] [\-e sql] [file]" 4
.IX Item "loop [-i] [-n] [-e sql] [file]"
The  \fB\eloop\fR  command reads input either from a file, a supplied \s-1SQL\s0
statement, or from a user (see  the  options  below),  determining
whether  the  current  line  is a portion of a \s-1TSQL\s0 statement or a
sqsh command, and performing the appropriate action.  When run  in
an  interactive  mode \fB\eloop\fR is also responsible for displaying the
current prompt (see \fB$prompt\fR below).
.Sp
\&\fB\eloop\fR completes when all input has been depleted  (end\-of\-file  is
encountered)  or when a command, such as \fB\eexit\fR requests that \fB\eloop\fR
exit.
.RS 4
.IP "\-i" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Normally, if \fIfile\fR is supplied and does not exist, \fB\eloop\fR  will
return with an error condition, usually causing sqsh to exit.
By supplying the \fB\-i\fR flag, control will  be  returned  to  the
calling  loop  as  if  end-of-file had been reached (that is,
with no error condition).
.IP "\-n" 4
.IX Item "-n"
By default, \fB\eloop\fR will automatically attempt  to  connect  to
the database if a connection has not already been established
via the \fB\econnect\fR command.  The \fB\-n\fR flag disables this behavior
allowing  \fB\eloop\fR  to  process  commands  that  do  not require
database support.
.IP "\-e sql" 4
.IX Item "-e sql"
Causes \fB\eloop\fR to process the contents of \fIsql\fR as  if  the  user
had  typed  it  at  the prompt and an implicit call to \fB\ego\fR is
automatically  appended  to  the  statement. If multiple
instances  of  \fB\-e\fR are supplied, they are all sent as a single
batch to the \s-1SQL\s0 Server for processing.  This option may  not
be used in combination with a \fIfile\fR name as well.
.IP "file" 4
.IX Item "file"
Specifies  the name of a \fIfile\fR to be used as input rather than
reading input from the user or from the \fB\-e\fR flag.

\fIDatabase Access\fR
.IX Subsection "Database Access"
.PP
Given the size and complexity of sqsh (just look at the length of  this
man  page),  it  is amazing how few database manipulation commands that
there actually are.  The following are commands that affect or use  the
current database connection:
.IP "\econnect  [\-c] [\-D db] [\-S srv] [\-U user] [\-P pass] [\-I ifile] [\-K] [\-R server_principal]" 4
.IX Item "connect  [-c] [-D db] [-S srv] [-U user] [-P pass] [-I ifile] [-K] [-R server_principal]"
This  command  is  used  primarily for internal use to establish a
connection to a database.  If a connection is already  established
it has no effect, however if a connection has not been established
and  \fB$password\fR  has  not  been  supplied,  then  the  password  is
requested  and  a  connection is established. \fB\econnect\fR accepts the
following parameters:
.RS 4
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
By  default,  the  \fB\econnect\fR  command  uses  the  contents  of
\&\fB$database\fR  to  determine  the database context that should be
used upon  establishing  the  connection  (this  is  used  by
\&\fB\ereconnect\fR  to  preserve  the  current  database context upon
reconnection).  The \fB\-c\fR flag suppresses this behavior and  the
default database context of login is used instead.
.IP "\-D db" 4
.IX Item "-D db"
Causes  \fB\econnect\fR  to  attempt  to  automatically  switch  the
database context to \fIdb\fR  after  establishing  the  connection.
.Sp
Using  this  flag is identical to setting the \fB$database\fR variable prior to establishing the connection.
.IP "\-S srv" 4
.IX Item "-S srv"
The name of the Sybase \fIserver\fR to connect, this  defaults  to
\&\fB$DSQUERY\fR if not supplied.
.IP "\-U user" 4
.IX Item "-U user"
The  Sybase \fIuser\fR to connect to the database as, this defaults
to \fB$username\fR variable if not supplied.
.IP "\-P pass" 4
.IX Item "-P pass"
The \fIpassword\fR for \fIuser\fR required to connect  to  \fIserver\fR.   This
defaults to \fB$password\fR if not supplied.
.IP "\-I ifile" 4
.IX Item "-I ifile"
The  full path of an alternate Sybase \fIinterfaces\fR file to use.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\ereconnect [\-c] [\-D db] [\-S srv] [\-U user] [\-P pass] [\-I ifile]" 4
.IX Item "reconnect [-c] [-D db] [-S srv] [-U user] [-P pass] [-I ifile]"
The \fB\ereconnect\fR command may be used to force a reconnection to  the
database  using  a  new  username,  servername,  or  password  (if
desired).  If this command fails, the current  connection  remains
(if there is any), however if it succeeds then the current connec\-
tion is closed and the new connection becomes the only active one.
.Sp
All  arguments  that are accepted by \fB\econnect\fR are also accepted by
\&\fB\ereconnect\fR (in fact \fB\ereconnect\fR uses \fB\econnect\fR to establish the  new
connection).
.IP "\ego [options] [xacts]" 4
.IX Item "go [options] [xacts]"
Sends  the contents of the \fBWork Buffer\fR to the database, establishing a 
new connection to the database if one does not already exist
(by  calling the \fB\econnect\fR above).  It them displays the results of
the query back to stdout and returns, causing the \fBWork Buffer\fR  to
be cleared and moved to the end of the \fBHistory Buffer\fR.
.Sp
If the \fBWork Buffer\fR is empty and the \fB$repeat_batch\fR variable is set
to \*(L"On\*(R", \fB\ego\fR will attempt to  re-run  the  last  command  executed
(this  will  only  work  in interactive mode if history support is
enabled).
.Sp
\&\fB\ego\fR accepts the following arguments:
.RS 4
.IP "\-d display" 4
.IX Item "-d display"
If X11 support is compiled into sqsh, and X display  mode  is
being  used (see \fB\-x\fR, below), then \fIdisplay\fR will be used as the
X display area for the result set.  By default  the  environment variable \fB$DISPLAY\fR is assumed.
.IP "\-f" 4
.IX Item "-f"
Turns  off  the  display  of  the  footer  message  \*(L"(%d rows affected)\*(R". Footer messages may also be turned  off  via  the
\&\fB$footers\fR variable.
.IP "\-h" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Turns  off  all  column headers. These may also be turned off via the \fB$headers\fR variable.
.IP "\-m style" 4
.IX Item "-m style"
Temporarily changes the  display style to \fIstyle\fR for the duration of the command. Currently supported styles are 
\&\fBhoriz\fR (or \fBhor\fR or \fBhorizontal\fR), \fBvert\fR  (or  \fBvertical\fR),  \fBbcp\fR,  \fBhtml\fR,  \fBmeta\fR,
\&\fBpretty\fR and \fBnone\fR. The display style may be permanently set via
the \fB$style\fR variable or the \fB\-m\fR command line flag.
.IP "\-n" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Turns off variable expansion in  the  \fBWork Buffer\fR  prior  to
sending it to the server, this may also be turned off via the
\&\fB$expand\fR variable.
.IP "\-p" 4
.IX Item "-p"
Turns on output of performance statistics when the result set
has  been  successfully  returned  from the server.  This may
also be turned on via the \fB\-p\fR command line argument  to  sqsh,
or the \fB$statistics\fR variable.
.IP "\-s sec" 4
.IX Item "-s sec"
If  the value of \fIxacts\fR is greater than 1, this causes sqsh to
sleep for \fIsec\fR seconds before executing the next  transaction.
Note  that  the time spent sleeping is excluded from the statistical information displayed with the \fB\-p\fR flag.
.IP "\-t [filter]" 4
.IX Item "-t [filter]"
Filters the command batch through an external  program,  \fIfilter\fR, prior to being sent to the \s-1SQL\s0 Server.  If \fIfilter\fR is not
supplied, then \fB$filter_prog\fR is used (default is ‘m4 \-’). This
value  may also be set via the \fB$filter\fR and \fB$filter_prog\fR variables.
.IP "\-w width" 4
.IX Item "-w width"
Overrides the value of \fB$width\fR for the life of the query  (see
\&\fB$width\fR below).
.IP "\-x [xgeom]" 4
.IX Item "-x [xgeom]"
Turns  on  the  X11  display  filter  (only if X11 support is
comiled into sqsh), which causes the result set to be sent to
a  separate  window.   If  \fIxgeom\fR is supplied, then this value
will be used as \fB$xgeom\fR for the life of the query (see  \fB$xgeom\fR
below).
.IP "xacts" 4
.IX Item "xacts"
Specifies  number  of  times  the contents of the \fBWork Buffer\fR
should be executed.  Note that, similar to isql, a result set
will  only  be  displayed  during  the final execution of the
batch.  Also, the  contents  of  the  \fBWork  Buffer\fR  are  only
expanded  once, prior to the first execution, so the contents
of the buffer will not change between subsequent  executions.

.IP "\ebcp [bcp_options] table" 4
.IX Item "bcp [bcp_options] table"
The  \fB\ebcp\fR  commands  acts  as  a sort of enhanced \fB\ego\fR command that
redirects the result set(s) of the batch to another server via the
bcp protocol.  While it is possible to \fB\ebcp\fR the result set back to
the current server (the \fB$DSQUERY\fR variable), this is achieved  more
easily via a \s-1SELECT\s0 \s-1INTO\s0.
.Sp
The  nitty-gritty  details of \fB\ebcp\fR go like this: First the current
\&\s-1SQL\s0 batch is expanded (unless the \fB$expand\fR variable is  set  to  0)
and shipped off to the database for processing.  If all goes well,
a new connection is established to the  destination  database  (as
specified  via \f(CW$DSQUERY\fR or the \fB\-S\fR flag) to transfer the result set
using bcp.  Then, the output of the source database connection  is
bound to the new bcp connection and data transfer is performed.
\&\fB\ebcp\fR  can handle multiple result sets without any problem (including 
result sets returned from stored  procedures,  etc.)  provided
that all of the result sets are valid for the destination table.
.Sp
The  equivalent of a \*(L"bcp out\*(R" may be performed using the \fBbcp\fR display 
style setting and file redirection (see the \fB$style\fR variable).
.RS 4
.IP "\-A packet" 4
.IX Item "-A packet"
Specifies  the  \s-1TDS\s0  packet size used to communicate with the
destination server.  If not supplied  this  defaults  to  the
value the \fB$packet_size\fR variable, or (if that is not set), the
default server packet size (usually 512 bytes).
.IP "\-b batch_size" 4
.IX Item "-b batch_size"
The number of records transferred  in  a  single  transaction
between  servers.   Note  that  reaching  the end of a result
causes the batch to be transferred, regardless of  the  value
of \fIbatch_size\fR.  The default is the entire result set.
.IP "\-I ifile" 4
.IX Item "-I ifile"
The  full path of an alternate Sybase \fIinterfaces\fR file to use.
.IP "\-J charset" 4
.IX Item "-J charset"
Specifies the default \fIcharset\fR used to  communicate  with  the
\&\s-1SQL\s0  Server.  This defaults to the current character set (the
value of the \fB$charset\fR variable).
.IP "\-m maxerr" 4
.IX Item "-m maxerr"
The maximum number of batches that may fail before \fB\ebcp\fR gives
up  the ghost (default is 10). Note, that this only refers to
failures within a given batch. When performing a bcp of  multiple  
result  sets  to  a server, if a given result set has,
say, too many columns or bad data types, then the entire  bcp
process is aborted regardless of the value of \fImaxerr\fR.
.IP "\-N" 4
.IX Item "-N"
Indicates that the value for an identity column in the destination 
table is being supplied within the result set.
.IP "\-P pass" 4
.IX Item "-P pass"
The \fIpassword\fR for \fIuser\fR required to connect  to  \fIserver\fR.   This
defaults to \fB$password\fR if not supplied.
.IP "\-S serv" 4
.IX Item "-S serv"
The  name  of  the Sybase \fIserver\fR to connect, this defaults to
\&\fB$DSQUERY\fR if not supplied.
.IP "\-U user" 4
.IX Item "-U user"
The Sybase \fIuser\fR to connect to the database as, this  defaults
to \fB$username\fR variable if not supplied.
.IP "\-X" 4
.IX Item "-X"
Causes password negotiation with the destination server to be
performed using client-side encryption.
.IP "table" 4
.IX Item "table"
As with regular \fBbcp\fR, \fItable\fR may be either a fully or partially
specified  table  name in the destination server.  Note, that
since a new database connection is established during the bcp

.IP "\erpc [rpc_opt] rpc_name [[parm_opt] [@var=]value ...]" 4
.IX Item "rpc [rpc_opt] rpc_name [[parm_opt] [@var=]value ...]"
The \fB\erpc\fR command is used to directly  invoke  a  stored  procedure
call in the connected server.  This command is particularly useful
for communicating with an Open Server that does not directly  sup\-
port language calls.
.Sp
\&\fB\erpc\fR invokes the remote procedure \fIrpc_name\fR with one or more parameters
that may be named (using \fI@var\fR) or anonymous (by not  supplying a name).
Unfortunately,  due  to  the  fact that Sybase’s implementation of
RPC’s, does not directly support most implicit data  type  conversions
(mainly  between \s-1VARCHAR\s0 (the string you supply on the command line) 
and the most other data types (that the  remote  procedure  is  expecting),  
the syntax for the \fB\erpc\fR command is somewhat
complex.  However, in short here is how things work:
.Sp
As the \fB\erpc\fR command line is being parsed, \fIsqsh\fR attempts  to  guess
the  data  type  of  the  parameter \fIvalue\fR based on the format (for
example if it contains only digits, it is assumed to be  an  integer), 
\&\fIsqsh\fR then performs an explicit data type conversion prior to
calling the remote procedure call.  If \fIsqsh\fR guesses wrong, several
flags  are  supplied  to force it to perform the correct data type
conversion (see \fBparm_opt\fR).
.Sp
\fIDisplay Opions\fR
.IX Subsection "Display Opions"

The following options may be supplied anywhere on the command line
and  are  used  to  affect  the  manner in which the result set(s)
returning from the remote procedure call are displayed:
.RS 4
.IP "\-d display" 4
.IX Item "-d display"
If X support is compiled into sqsh, the value of  \fIdisplay\fR  is
used  as  the X windows \s-1DISPLAY\s0 variable.  Note, this is usually 
supplied with the \fB\-x\fR flag, below.
.IP "\-f" 4
.IX Item "-f"
Turns off  the  display  of  the  footer  message  \*(L"(%d  rows affected)\*(R".  
Footer  messages  may also be turned off via the \fB$footers\fR variable.
.IP "\-h" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Turns off all column headers. These may also  be  turned  off
via the \fB$headers\fR variable.
.IP "\-m style" 4
.IX Item "-m style"
Temporarily changes the  display style to \fIstyle\fR for the duration of the command. 
Currently supported styles are \fBhoriz\fR (or
\&\fBhor\fR  or  \fBhorizontal\fR),  \fBvert\fR  (or  \fBvertical\fR), \fBbcp\fR, \fBhtml\fR, \fBmeta\fR,
\&\fBpretty\fR and \fBnone\fR. The display style may be permanently set via
the \fB$style\fR variable or the \fB\-m\fR command line flag.

Temporarily  sets the output width to \fIwidth\fR. The output width
may be perminantly set via the \fI$width\fR varable.

The following options may be supplied immediatly prior to specifying a

interprets the contents of the \fIvalue\fR prior to calling  the  remote
procedure.   Although  \fIsqsh\fR  will  allow  any combination of these
parameters to be combined, it only really makes sense  to  combine
the \fB\-x\fR flag with any other flag.
.IP "\-b" 4
.IX Item "-b"
Indicates  that  the  \fIvalue\fR  that is specified should be converted 
to \s-1VARBINARY\s0 before calling \fIrpc_name\fR.   This  flag  is
implicit  (i.e.  you need not supply it) if \fIvalue\fR starts with
\&\*(L"0x\*(R" and contains only digits.
.IP "\-c" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Indicates that the \fIvalue\fR that is  specified  should  be  converted  
to  \s-1VARCHAR\s0  prior to calling \fIrpc_name\fR.  This flag is
implicit if \fIvalue\fR does not match any of the implicit  conversions 
for the other data types.
.IP "\-d" 4
.IX Item "-d"
Indicates  that  the  \fIvalue\fR  that is specified should be converted to 
double (float) before calling \fIrpc_name\fR.  This  flag
is  implicit  if  \fIvalue\fR  is  in valid floating point notation
(e.g, 0.1, .1, 1.4e10, or 4e10).
.IP "\-i" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Indicates that the \fIvalue\fR that is  specified  should  be  converted  $
to  integer (int) before calling \fIrpc_name\fR.  This flag
is implicit if \fIvalue\fR contains only digits (and, optionally, a
leading sign).
.IP "\-y" 4
.IX Item "-y"
Indicates  that  the  \fIvalue\fR  that is specified should be converted to  money  before  calling  \fIrpc_name\fR.   This  flag  is
implicit if \fIvalue\fR begins with a \*(L"$\*(R", and contains only digits
and, optionally, a decimal.
.IP "\-n" 4
.IX Item "-n"
Indicates that the \fIvalue\fR that is  specified  should  be  converted to numeric before calling \fIrpc_name\fR. This flag is never
implicit, as \fIvalue\fR would always  match  either  int  (\fB\-i\fR)  or
float  (\fB\-d\fR);  however, both of these types will implicitly be
converted to a numeric as necessary by the procedure call.
.IP "\-u" 4

.IX Item "reset"
The \fB\ereset\fR command corresponds directly to the \fIisql\fR  ‘reset’  command, 
returning a request to the read-eval-print loop to clear the
contents of the current \fBWork Buffer\fR and, if  you  are  running  in
interactive  mode,  place  a  copy  of the buffer into the \fBHistory Buffer\fR.  
The alias \fBreset\fR is automatically established upon  startup of \fIsqsh\fR 
for backward compatibility with \fIisql\fR.
.IP "\eredraw" 4
.IX Item "redraw"
Returns  a request back to the current read-eval-print loop for it
to redisplay the current \fBWork Buffer\fR.  If run from non-interactive

.IP "\ehistory" 4
.IX Item "history"
Displays  the last \fB$histsize\fR batches that have either been sent to
the database via the \fB\ego\fR command or cleared from the  \fBWork Buffer\fR
via the \fB\ereset\fR command.
.IP "\ebuf\-copy dst-buffer [src\-buffer]" 4
.IX Item "buf-copy dst-buffer [src-buffer]"
Copies  the  contents  of  \fIsrc-buffer\fR  (defaults  to  \fB!.\fR, the \fBWork Buffer\fR,

.IP "\ebuf\-get buffer" 4
.IX Item "buf-get buffer"
The  \fB\ebuf\-get\fR command is supplied as a shorthand method of running

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \ebuf_append !. buffer
.Ve
.IP "\ebuf\-append dst-buffer [src\-buffer]" 4
.IX Item "buf-append dst-buffer [src-buffer]"
Appends the contents of \fIsrc-buffer\fR (defaults to !.)  to  the  contents of 
\&\fIdst-buffer\fR, if it exists.  If \fIdst-buffer\fR doesn’t exist it
is created.
.IP "\ebuf\-save [\-a] filename [src\-buffer]" 4
.IX Item "buf-save [-a] filename [src-buffer]"
Saves the contents of \fIsrc-buffer\fR (defaults to !.) to \fIfilename\fR.  If
the  \fB\-a\fR  flag  is  supplied  the contents are appended to \fIfilename\fR
rather than overwriting the current contents.
.IP "\ebuf\-load [\-a] filename [dst\-buffer]" 4
.IX Item "buf-load [-a] filename [dst-buffer]"
Copies the contents of \fIfilename\fR in \fIdst-buffer\fR  (defaults  to  !.).
If  the \fB\-a\fR flag is supplied, the contents of \fIfilename\fR are appended
to \fIdst-buffer\fR.  Note that it is illegal to attempt to write to the
contents of the history buffer.
.IP "\ebuf\-show [buffer]" 4
.IX Item "buf-show [buffer]"
Displays  the contents of the named \fIbuffer\fR.  If \fIbuffer\fR is not supplied, 
then the contents of all named buffers are displayed.  This
command  is  slightly different from the commands above in that it
is only legal to supply a \fBNamed Buffer\fR  \fIbuffer\fR,  \fBHistory Buffers\fR,
and the \fBWork Buffer\fR will have no results.
.IP "\ebuf\-edit [\-r read\-buf] [\-w write\-buf]" 4
.IX Item "buf-edit [-r read-buf] [-w write-buf]"
The \fB\ebuf\-edit\fR command is used to edit the contents of a buffer and
place the changes into another buffer.  This command may  only  be
run  while  in  interactive mode. If \fIread-buf\fR is not supplied then
the buffer to be edited defaults to !., if it is not empty, otherwise  it  defaults  to  
!!.  If \fIwrite-buf\fR is not supplied then the
edited buffer is written back to !..
.Sp
By default, \fB\ebuf\-edit\fR uses the environment variable \fB$EDITOR\fR first,
followed  by  \fB$VISUAL\fR to determine which editor to use, defaulting
to ‘vi’ if the variable is not set.
.Sp
It is important to note that as of release 1.2,  \fB\ebuf\-edit\fR  is  no
longer  able  to use the name of an alias to it as the name of the
editor to launch. This is primarily  due  to  the  change  in  the
behavior of alias (see section \fBAliasing\fR, below, for details).
.Sp
The  commands \fBedit vi\fR and \fBemacs\fR are automatically established upon
startup of \fIsqsh\fR for backward compatibility with \fIisql\fR.

If no arguments are supplied to \fB\eset\fR then the  current  values  of

to \fIvalue\fR.  Note that some internal variables  (see  \fB\s-1SPECIAL\s0 \s-1VARIABLES\s0\fR)  
may  only  be  set with certain \fIvalue\fRs, so this action may
fail, leaving the previous contents on \fIname\fR intact.  The \fB\-x\fR  flag
causes  the variable to be exported to the environment of any programs 
launched from \fIsqsh\fR.
.Sh "Job Control"
.IX Subsection "Job Control"
The following commands are used to view the status  of,  or  manipulate
background jobs that are currently running, these correspond roughly to
the commands supplied by such shells as \fB\f(BIcsh\fB\|(1)\fR.
.IP "\ejobs" 4
.IX Item "jobs"
Displays the status  of  any  currently  running  jobs,  including
whether  or not these jobs have pending output, how long they have
been running, and when they were started.
.IP "\ewait [job_id]" 4
.IX Item "wait [job_id]"
Will pause until job designated by \fIjob_id\fR completes.  If \fIjob_id\fR is
a  negative  number  then  \fB\ewait\fR will pause until \fIany\fR pending jobs
completes.  If there are no  jobs  pending,  or  \fIjob_id\fR  does  not
belong to a running job, then an error message is displayed.
.IP "\ekill job_id" 4
.IX Item "kill job_id"
Terminates  the  job specified by \fIjob_id\fR, throwing away any output
that may be deferred for the job. If \fIjob_id\fR is not a  running  job
then an error message is displayed.
.IP "\eshow job_id" 4
.IX Item "show job_id"
Displays  the  deferred  output of completed background job \fIjob_id\fR
and removes the job from the list of pending  jobs  (removing  the
defer file in the process).  If \fIjob_id\fR is still running, or is not
a valid complete job, then an error message is displayed.
.Sh "Aliasing"
.IX Subsection "Aliasing"
As of release 1.2, \fIsqsh\fR supports full \fIcsh\fR\-style command aliasing.  With
this  feature,  \fIsqsh\fR  checks  the first word of each line, \fIprior to any
form of expansion\fR, to see if it matches the name of an existing  alias.
If  it  does,  the  command  is  reprocessed  with the alias definition
replacing its name.  Unlike \fIcsh\fR, however, only one form of history substitution  
is available within an alias: the ‘\fB!*\fR’ entry, indicating the
current line being expanded. If no history expansion is called for, the
arguments on the command line remain unchanged.
.PP
Like  \fIcsh\fR,  aliases  are  not  recursively expanded, so it is perfectly
legal to create an alias that expands to a command by the same name.
.PP
The following command is used to create an alias:
.IP "\ealias [alias_name=alias_body]" 4
.IX Item "alias [alias_name=alias_body]"
If no arguments are supplied to the \fB\ealias\fR command, then the  list
of  aliases  currently in effect is displayed.  Otherwise, it creates 
a new  alias  with  a  name  of  \fIalias_name\fR  and  a  body  of
\&\fIalias_body\fR;  if \fIalias_name\fR already exists the body of the existing
\&\fIalias_name\fR is replaced with the new definition.
.Sp
After defining the new alias,  whenever  \fIsqsh\fR  encounters  a  line
beginning  with  \fIalias_name\fR, the remainder of the line is replaced
with \fIalias_body\fR before any further processing is performed.
.Sp
If the string ‘\fB!*\fR’ exists anywhere within  \fIalias_body\fR,  the  arguments  
supplied to the alias are inserted at that point, otherwise
the argument are appended to the end of the alias definition.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    1> \ealias hi='\eecho !* said hello'
\&    1> hi Scott
\&    Scott said hello
.Ve
.Sp
where  as  if  the  alias does not include the \fB!*\fR keyword, then it
behaves like so:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    1> \ealias hi='\eecho said hello'
\&    1> hi Scott
\&    said hello Scott
.Ve
.Sp
It is perfectly legal to include a \fB!*\fR  more  than  once  within  a
given  \fIalias_body\fR.  Currently there is no way to escape the string
\&\fB!*\fR, if you really need this feature send me mail.
.IP "\eunalias alias_name" 4
.IX Item "unalias alias_name"
Removes \fIalias_name\fR.
.Sh "Miscellaneous"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous"
The left over commands.
.IP "\eexit" 4
.IX Item "exit"
The \fB\eexit\fR command requests  that  current  read-eval-print  loop
cease processing.  When the last loop returns, \fIsqsh\fR \fB\f(BIexit\fB\|(1)\fRs.
.IP "\eabort" 4
.IX Item "abort"
Causes  all  nested  read-eval-print  loops to abort processing,
causing \fIsqsh\fR to exit with an exit value of 254 (see section \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR).
.IP "\eread [\-a] [\-n] [\-h] var_name" 4
.IX Item "read [-a] [-n] [-h] var_name"
Reads  a  line  of  input from the user, placing the text of the
line in the variable \fIvar_name\fR.  If the  \fB\-n\fR  is  used,  then  the
trailing new-line is left on the line of text, and if \fB\-a\fR is supplied, 
then the text of the line is  appended  to  the  existing
value of \fIvar_name\fR.  The \fB\-h\fR flag turns off echoing of typed characters back to the user.
.IP "\esleep seconds" 4
.IX Item "sleep seconds"
Causes \fIsqsh\fR too  pause  for  \fIseconds\fR.   This  is  useful  within
scripts of batches need to need to pause briefly between batches
(it was primarily useful to me for testing background jobs).
.IP "\eecho [\-n] [args ...]" 4
.IX Item "echo [-n] [args ...]"
Just like the \s-1UNIX\s0 \fB\f(BIecho\fB\|(1)\fR, this prints its arguments to stdout,
followed  by  a  new\-line.  If the \fB\-n\fR flag is supplied, the newline is omitted.
.IP "\ewarranty" 4
.IX Item "warranty"
Displays the standard \s-1GNU\s0 warranty.
.IP "\ehelp [command]" 4
.IX Item "help [command]"
Without any arguments \fB\ehelp\fR displays  a  brief  list  of  all
available  commands,  otherwise,  it  provides specific help for
\&\fIcommand\fR, if available. When help is requested on a specific \fIcommand\fR,
\&\fB\ehelp\fR  looks  for the file \fI$help_dir/command.hlp\fR and displays it to stdout.
.IP "\eshell [shell command]" 4
.IX Item "shell [shell command]"
If \fIshell command\fR is not supplied then \fIsqsh\fR executes \fB$SHELL\fR.   If
the  \fB$SHELL\fR variable has not been set, then, by default, /bin/sh
is executed.  Otherwise, if \fIshell command\fR is supplied then it is
executed.   The exit status of the command executed is stored in
the special \fB$?\fR  read-only environment variable.
.IP "\elock" 4
.IX Item "lock"
Locks the current session until the correct password  is  typed.
By  default  \fB\elock\fR  attempts  to  use  the  \s-1UNIX\s0  password (from
/etc/passwd) associated with the user running \fIsqsh\fR,  however  if
the  \fB$lock\fR variable is set then the contents of that is used for
validation instead.
.Sp
Note, on systems using  Shadow  Passwords  (in  which  even  the
encypted  password  is  unavailable), \fB\elock\fR will only work using
the \fB$lock\fR variable.
.Sh "Aliases"
.IX Subsection "Aliases"
The following aliases are established upon startup  of  \fIsqsh\fR,  and  are
provided  primarily for backward compatibility with \fIisql\fR.  These may be
removed at any time using the \fB\eunalias\fR command (either at  the  prompt,
or within your .sqshrc file).
.IP "!" 4
The  \fB!\fR   alias is provided as a \fB\f(BIcsh\fB\|(1)\fR\-like history mechanism, and
is an alias of \fB\ebuf\-append\fR.  With release 0.7, this alias is  provided  
only  for backwards compatibility with previous releases of

.PP
\fIIn-Line \ego\fR
.IX Subsection "In-Line go"
.PP
If  the  variable  \fB$semicolon_hack\fR is set to 1 (on), then sqsh supports
what is called an in-line \fB\ego\fR feature.  This allows the current command
batch  to  be  terminated  and sent to the database in a single step by
appending a ‘;’ onto the end of the current work buffer. This allows
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1> sp_who;
.Ve
.PP
To behave in the same manner as if you had typed:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> sp_who
\&    2> \ego
.Ve
.PP
Likewise, anything following the semicolon is passed to the \fB\ego\fR command
just as if it was run as a normal command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    1> sp_who ; 2>/dev/null | more
.Ve
.PP
Unlike  most  other  \fIisql\fR replacements, \fIsqsh\fR attempts to be smart about
the semicolons.  If a semicolon is contained within a set of single  or
double  quotes  it  will  not  be  interpreted.  This includes multiple
quotes.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select "This is a multiple line
\&    2> quote; it is smart!" ;
.Ve
.PP
In the above example, only the second semicolon (the one at the end  of
the line) will be interpreted.

a "use \fB$autouse\fR" once a connection has been established.
.Sp
This variable may also be set using the \fB\-D\fR command  line
option.
.IP "banner (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "banner (boolean)"
Turns  off the banner message displayed on startup, this
variable defaults to 1 and may also be turned off  using
the \fB\-b\fR command line argument.
.IP "batch_failcount (int)" 4
.IX Item "batch_failcount (int)"
This internal variable is used to keep track of the number of batches that have failed to execute (essentially,
the  number of times that the error handler was called).
.Sp
A batch is considered failed whenever an error of severity  
\&\fB$thresh_fail\fR is encountered.  When \fB$batch_failcount\fR
reaches \fB$thresh_exit\fR \fIsqsh\fR exits with an  exit  value  of
the  total  number of batches that have failed.  Setting
\&\fB$batch_failcount\fR to the string "" will cause it to reset
to zero, any other value may have unpredictable results.
.Sp
See \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR for details.
.IP "batch_pause (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "batch_pause (boolean)"
Causes a \*(L"Paused. Hit enter to continue...\*(R"  message  to
be  displayed  after each batch is executed.  This variable, 
in conjunction with \fB$echo\fR is  good  for  debugging
\&\s-1SQL\s0 scripts.
.IP "bcp_colsep (string)" 4
.IX Item "bcp_colsep (string)"
Used  as  a  separator  between columns during \s-1BCP\s0 style
output (see the \fB$style\fR configuration variable and the \fB\-m\fR
option to the \fB\ego\fR command).  The default setting is \*(L"|\*(R".
.IP "bcp_rowsep (string)" 4
.IX Item "bcp_rowsep (string)"
Used as a separator between rows during \s-1BCP\s0 style output
(see the \fB$style\fR configuration variable and the \fB\-m\fR option
to the \fB\ego\fR command).  Note that,  a  newline  (\*(L"\en\*(R")  is
automatically appended this this value and should not be
supplied. The default setting is \*(L"|\*(R".
.IP "bcp_trim (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "bcp_trim (boolean)"
Controls whether or not \s-1BCP\s0 style output trims  trailing
spaces  from  fixed  length  columns.   The  default  is
\&\*(L"True\*(R".
.IP "chained (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "chained (boolean)"
If set then sqsh uses  the  \*(L"chained\*(R"  transaction  mode
(aka  \*(L"AutoCommit  off\*(R").  Setting this has \s-1NO\s0 effect on
the current connection. It can be set  via  the  command
line argument \fB\-n\fR.
.IP "charset (string)" 4
.IX Item "charset (string)"
If  this variable is set prior to establishing a connection 
with \s-1SQL\s0 Server, then during  the  connection  \fIsqsh\fR
will  request  that the server transform to and from the
requested \fIcharset\fR.   After  establishing  a  connection,
this  variable  is  automatically  set  to  the  current
character set in use.
.IP "clear_on_fail (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "clear_on_fail (boolean)"
Normally, whenever the \fB\ego\fR command is run,  \fIsqsh\fR  clears
the  current work buffer of its contents, moving them to
history.  Setting \fB$clear_on_fail\fR to 0, leaves  the  current
work  buffer  intact  if a failure is encountered
while sending the contents to the database.  The default
value is 1, or on.
.IP "colsep (string)" 4
.IX Item "colsep (string)"
Causes  the string \fIcolsep\fR to be used to delimit \s-1SQL\s0 column 
output columns, this defaults to \*(L" \*(R", it may also be
set via the command line argument \fB\-s\fR.
.IP "colwidth (int)" 4
.IX Item "colwidth (int)"
Used  to  control  the maximum column width displayed by
the \fBpretty\fR display style (see \fB$style\fR below).  If  a  row
of  a column exceeds this width, it will be wrapped in a
relatively visually appealing manner at \fB$colwidth\fR  characters.   
Note,  however, that if there is enough screen
width to hold all  columns  \fB$colwidth\fR  may  be  exceeded
until the width of the screen is reached.
.IP "date (date\-spec)" 4
.IX Item "date (date-spec)"
This variable may be set with a date format (see the man
page for \fB\f(BIdate\fB\|(1)\fR), and the variable expands to the  current  
date  in  the supplied format.  The default format
for this variable is \f(CW%d\fR\-%b\-%y (e.g. 02\-Feb\-1996).
.IP "datetime (date\-spec)" 4
.IX Item "datetime (date-spec)"
This variable may be set with a date format  similar  to
\&\fB$date\fR  and \fB$time\fR and is used to control the display format  
of  all  \s-1SQL\s0  Server  \s-1DATETIME\s0  and   \s-1SMALLDATETIME\s0
columns.
.Sp
Note that this features relies upon the operating system
specific locale information for determining such  things
as  the  name  of  the  month and day, rather than going
through the CT-Lib locale information.  This means  that
the  date format could potentially miss-match the locale
as requested using the \fB\-z\fR flag. For example, if Isqsh>  is
run on an operating system configure for \s-1US\s0 English, but
requests French as the language of choice using \fB\-z\fR,  the
use  of  \fB$datetime\fR will cause all date information to be
displayed in \s-1US\s0 English rather than French.
.Sp
Ordinary characters defined in the variable are left  in
place  without any conversion. Characters introducted by
a ‘%’ character are replaced during display of a  column
value as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "[]" 4
Any  contained  between  a  pair of braces (‘[’ and
‘]’) will be removed when displaying  \s-1SMALLDATETIME\s0
columns.   This  feature is particularly useful for
removing the seconds and milliseconds values  which
are  not  applicable  to \s-1SMALLDATETIME\s0 anyway.  For
\&\s-1DATETIME\s0 columns, only the actual  braces  will  be
removed.
.IP "%a" 4
.IX Item "%a"

.RE
.IP "database (string)" 4
.IX Item "database (string)"
If this variable is set prior to establishing a  connection  
to  the  \s-1SQL\s0 Server, the a "use \fB$database\fR" is performed immediately after the connection is  established.
Once  a  connection  has  been established this variable
will automatically be set to the current  database  context.
.IP "debug (string)" 4
.IX Item "debug (string)"
If \fIsqsh\fR has been compiled with debugging enabled (\-DDEBUG), this variable may be used to control the amount of
debugging output displayed.  \fB$debug\fR may be set to a pipe
(|) delimited (logical \s-1OR\s0) set of the following words to
turn  on  various pieces of debugging: \fB\s-1FD\s0\fR, \fB\s-1SIGCHLD\s0\fR, \fB\s-1ENV\s0\fR,
\&\fB\s-1JOB\s0\fR, \fB\s-1AVL\s0\fR, or \fB\s-1ALL\s0\fR.
.IP "defer_bg (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "defer_bg (boolean)"
Normally, when a job is run the in the background (via a
‘&’  on  the  command  line),  the  output of the job is
deferred to a temporary file (located in \fI$tmp_dir\fR) until
the  user requests the output to be displayed.  This way
the results of the job will not interfere with what  the
user is going.  Setting this variable
.IP "echo (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "echo (boolean)"
Setting \fB$echo\fR to on (1) causes each command submitted to
the database via the \fB\ego\fR command to be  displayed  prior
to  the  output.   This variable defaults to 0 (or off),
and may also be set using the \fB\-e\fR command line option.
.IP "encryption (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "encryption (boolean)"
Setting the \fB$encryption\fR variable prior to establishing a
connection to the server will cause the login connection
to be initiated using client-side  password  encryption.
This  variable may also be set using the \fB\-X\fR command line
option.
.IP "exit_failcount (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "exit_failcount (boolean)"
Settings this value to 1 causes \fIsqsh\fR to return  an  exit
status  of  \fB$batch_failcount\fR  rather than 0, upon a non\-
error termination.  See \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR  for  details.   The
default value is 0.
.IP "expand (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "expand (boolean)"
Be default when the \fB\ego\fR command is executed the contents
of the current work buffer is expanded of  all  environment  variables  prior to being sent to the database for
execution. By setting this variable to \*(L"0\*(R",  the  buffer
will  no  longer  be  expanded  before being sent to the
database.  This is  useful  when  you  either  (1)  have
strings  in  the buffer that contain a ‘$’ and you don’t
want them to be expanded, or (2)  for  performance  rea\-
sons; it takes time (and an extra copy of the buffer) to
perform the variable expansion.
.IP "filter (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "filter (boolean)"
Toggles the filtering the \s-1SQL\s0 batch through an  external
program  (defined  by  the \fB$filter_prog\fR variable, below)
prior to being sent to the \s-1SQL\s0 Server. Default  is  ‘0’,
or ‘off’.
.IP "filter_prog (string)" 4
.IX Item "filter_prog (string)"
Defines the external program through which the \s-1SQL\s0 batch
will be filtered prior to being sent to the \s-1SQL\s0  Server.
This  variable  is  ignored  if \fB$filter\fR is set to ‘0’ or
‘off’.  The default is ‘m4 \-’.
.IP "float (float\-format)" 4
.IX Item "float (float-format)"
Defines the display format (the precision and scale) for
all  floating  point  values  displayed  by  sqsh.   The
default is  ‘18.6’.   Note  that  values  exceeding  the
defined  precision  are  not  truncated, so setting this
value too low may cause columns in a result  set  to  be
miss\-aligned.
.IP "footers (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "footers (boolean)"
Toggles the \*(L"(%d rows affected)\*(R" following a result set.
The default for this variable is ‘1’.
.IP "headers (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "headers (boolean)"
Toggles the column headers preceding a result  set.  The
default for this variable is ‘1’.
.IP "help_dir (path)" 4
.IX Item "help_dir (path)"
This is the location of the help files used by the \fB\ehelp\fR
command,  typically  it  defaults  to   something   like
/usr/local/lib/sqsh/help.
.IP "histnum (int)" 4
.IX Item "histnum (int)"
Contains the history number that will be assigned to the
current command batch as soon as the \fB\ego\fR command is executed.  
This variable should be considered read\-only.
.IP "history (path)" 4
.IX Item "history (path)"
This  is  the location of the history file used to store
and retrieve a users history during start-up  and  shutdown.  
This defaults to \fI$HOME/.sqsh_history\fR.  This variable is expanded each time it  is  referenced  by  sqsh,
much  in  the  same  way  that  \fB$prompt\fR is each time the
prompt is displayed.
.IP "history_shorthand (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "history_shorthand (boolean)"
This variable is only meaningful within  an  interactive
session.   If set, it turns on the ability to append any
named buffer or history buffer  onto  the  current  work
buffer in a ‘sh’ history style, such as ‘!40’.  Be care\-
ful with this feature, \fIsqsh\fR is not terribly  intelligent
with  looking  for  history shorthand, so it is possible
that it may get confused (although, it is  smart  enough
to ignore !’s in quoted strings).
.IP "histsave (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "histsave (boolean)"
The  value  of this variable is used by \fIsqsh\fR to indicate
whether the history should be save to \fB$history\fR prior  to
shutdown.
.IP "histsize (int)" 4
.IX Item "histsize (int)"
The  value of this variable is used to alter the maximum
number of history entries are  are  maintained  by  \fIsqsh\fR
(the  default is 10).  Note that decreasing the value of
this variable causes some history entries to be lost.
.IP "histunique (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "histunique (boolean)"
If set, \fIsqsh\fR maintains a MRU-LRU order of executed buffers and does not store duplicate
command buffers. For example, observe the following situation:
.Sp
.Vb 15
\&   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> \ehistory
\&   (1) sp_who
\&   (2) grant role mon_role to sa_role
\&   (3) select * from monProcessActivity
\&   (4) select @@authmech,show_sec_services()
\&   (5) select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services()
\&   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> sp_who
\&   LINUX1502.user1.master.2> go
\&   ... output ommitted
\&   LINUX1502.user1.master.1> \ehistory
\&   (1) grant role mon_role to sa_role
\&   (2) select * from monProcessActivity
\&   (3) select @@authmech,show_sec_services()
\&   (4) select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services()
\&   (5) sp_who
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fIsp_who\fR is the last executed command and the buffer \- originally the last in the list \-
is now on top of the list.
.IP "hostname (string)" 4
.IX Item "hostname (string)"
Used during the connection process to  indicate  to  \s-1SQL\s0
Server  the name of the host from which \fIsqsh\fR is connecting.  
This variable may also be set using the \fB\-H\fR flag.
.IP "ignoreeof (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "ignoreeof (boolean)"
By default, \fIsqsh\fR terminates if the user presses ^d (control\-D) on
an empty line and readline support is compiled in. If \fB$ignoreeof\fR is set in 
the sqshrc file you get a warning message instead:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    CTRL-D: Use "exit" or "quit" to leave the sqsh shell.
.Ve
.Sp
This is equivalent to using \*(L"set \-o ignoreeof\*(R" in the bash shell.
.IP "interactive (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "interactive (boolean)"
This is a variable used internally and  should  probably
not  be  altered  by  the user.  If \fB$interactive\fR is ‘0’,
then the prompt is not displayed, the history is neither
read  nor written and some user messages are suppressed.
.IP "interfaces (path)" 4
.IX Item "interfaces (path)"
This is the full path name of the  interfaces  file,  it
defaults to \fI$SYBASE/interfaces\fR.
.IP "keyword_completion (int/string)" 4
.IX Item "keyword_completion (int/string)"
This  variable  only applies if \s-1GNU\s0 Readline support has
been compiled into \fIsqsh\fR.  \fB$keyword_completion\fR is used to
control the \s-1TSQL\s0 keyword completion feature in readline,
and may be set using either an integer between 0 and  4,
or  one  of  the  strings  \fInone\fR, \fIlower\fR, \fIupper\fR, \fIsmart\fR, or
\&\fIexact\fR.  If it is set to either 0 or \fInone\fR, then  no  keyword  
completion  is  performed  (this  is the default).
\&\fIlower\fR or 1, causes \fIsqsh\fR to complete the keyword in  lowercase,  
regardless  of the case that the partially completed keyword was typed. 
\&\fIupper\fR or 2  forces  completion
to  be  performed  in upper case, \fIsmart\fR, or 3, bases the
decision on case upon the first character of the partial
keyword,  and \fIexact\fR completes the keyword in exactly the
same case as defined in the \fI.sqsh_words\fR (for the  built-in 
\&\s-1TSQL\s0 keywords, this will be lower case).
.IP "keyword_file (string)" 4
.IX Item "keyword_file (string)"
If  readline  support  has  been compiled into \fIsqsh\fR, and
\&\fIsqsh\fR is being run in interactive mode, the  contents  of
this  file  are used for keyword tab completion by readline 
rather than the default  set  of  \s-1TSQL\s0  syntactical
keywords.  The default is \fI$HOME/.sqsh_words\fR.
.IP "language (string)" 4
.IX Item "language (string)"
The \fB$language\fR variable is used while establishing a connection 
to the server to specify the  national  language
used  to display system prompts and messages.  The variable will automatically 
track the current language  setting  of  the  server.  
This  may also be set via the \fB\-z\fR
flag.
.IP "lineno (int)" 4
.IX Item "lineno (int)"
This is an internal variable and should not  be  altered
by the user. It is used to maintain the line number that
is being typed into within the current work buffer.
.IP "linesep (string)" 4
.IX Item "linesep (string)"
Used to configure the line separator for the  horizontal
display style, this defaults to \*(L"\en\et\*(R".
.IP "lock (string/write\-only)" 4
.IX Item "lock (string/write-only)"
Defines the password to be used by the \fB\elock\fR command. If
unset or set to the string \*(L"\s-1NULL\s0\*(R", then the  \s-1UNIX\s0  password  
of  the  user  running \fIsqsh\fR is used instead (if possible).  Note
that \fB$lock\fR will always expand to the string \*(L"*lock*\*(R"  if
referenced.
.IP "login_timeout (int)" 4
.IX Item "login_timeout (int)"
The number of seconds to wait when attempting to create a new connection
to a data server. Default is 0 (infinite wait). See also the \fB\-T\fR
command line option.
.IP "newline_go (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "newline_go (boolean)"
This  flag  is  used  as a horrible kludge to support an
\&\*(L"empty\*(R" alias for the \fB\ego\fR command, that is, the  equivalent 
of supplying \*(L"\-c ’’\*(R" on the command line.  When on,
an empty line is interpreted as a call to the  \fB\ego\fR  command.   
This  feature is not recommended but is supplied
for completeness.
.IP "maxlen (int)" 4
.IX Item "maxlen (int)"
Controls the maximum amount of data that  will  be  displayed  
(in  any display mode) in a single column.  This
setting will automatically truncate the output  of  particularly  
large  datatypes  (such as \s-1TEXT\s0) to the value
supplied. The default setting is 8192 bytes (8KB).
.IP "max_timeout (int)" 4
.IX Item "max_timeout (int)"
Controls the number of times a query needs to reach its time-out value
before it is aborted. See \fBquery_timeout\fR and the \fB\-Q\fR command line flag.
.IP "output_parms (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "output_parms (boolean)"
Flag used to enable to disable  the  display  of  output
parameter  result  sets  from  stored  procedures.   The
default is to enable the display.
.IP "packet_size (int)" 4
.IX Item "packet_size (int)"
Defines the size of the \s-1TDS\s0 packets used to  communicate
with  \s-1SQL\s0.   Changing the value of the variable will not
affect the current connection but will take effect  upon
the next \fB\ereconnect\fR command.  Specifying a value of \s-1NULL\s0
indicates that the default packet size is desired.
.IP "password (string/write\-only)" 4
.IX Item "password (string/write-only)"
This is the users current password. A \s-1NULL\s0 password  may
be  assigned using an explicit \*(L"\s-1NULL\s0\*(R" string.  For security reasons, 
when  referenced  the  \fB$password\fR  variable
will always expand to the string \*(L"*password*\*(R".
.IP "prompt (string)" 4
.IX Item "prompt (string)"
This  variable  is  used  by  \fIsqsh\fR to build your current
prompt.   Any  variables  contain  within  \fB$prompt\fR   are
expanded each time the prompt is displayed.  The default
value for this is ‘${lineno}> ’.
.IP "prompt2 (string)" 4
.IX Item "prompt2 (string)"
This contents of this prompt are expanded and  displayed
during  interactive  use  when  \fIsqsh\fR requires additional
input, such as during a line continuation.  The  default
value is ‘\-\-> ’.
.IP "query_timeout (int)" 4
.IX Item "query_timeout (int)"
Number of seconds to wait for a query to return data. If the timeout is
reached the query is aborted (canceled). See also \fB$max_timeout\fR and
the \fB\-Q\fR command line option.
=item rcfile (path)
.Sp
Contains  a  colon  (:)  delimited list of sqsh resource
(sqshrc)    files.    The     default     setting     is
/usr/local/etc/sqshrc (unless overridden by the \-\-prefix
option   when   sqsh   was   compiled)    followed    by
\&\fI$HOME/.sqshrc\fR).
.IP "readline_history (string)" 4
.IX Item "readline_history (string)"
If  readline  support  has  been compiled into \fIsqsh\fR, the
contents of the readline line-by-line  history  will  be
written  to  the file specified by the \fB$readline_history\fR
variable.  The default is \fI$HOME/.sqsh_readline\fR.
.IP "readline_histsize (int)" 4
.IX Item "readline_histsize (int)"
If readline support has been  compiled  into  \fIsqsh\fR,  the
value  of  \fB$readline_histsize\fR  specifies  the  number of
lines that are saved in the readline  line-by-line  history.  
Setting this to a value of 0 causes every line to
be saved.  The default value is 100.
.IP "real (float\-format)" 4
.IX Item "real (float-format)"
Defines the display format (the precision and scale) for
all  real  values  displayed  by  sqsh.   The default is
‘18.6’.  Note that values exceeding the  defined  precision  
are  not  truncated, so setting this value too low
may cause columns in a result set to be miss\-aligned.
.IP "repeat_batch (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "repeat_batch (boolean)"
When set to \fBOn\fR or \fBTrue\fR, a \fB\ego\fR executed with an empty \fB\s-1SQL\s0 Buffer\fR  
will cause the previous batch to be re\-executed.
.IP "script (string)" 4
.IX Item "script (string)"
If \fIsqsh\fR is run using the \fB\-i\fR  flag,  then  this  variable
contains the name of the script being executed.
.IP "statistics (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "statistics (boolean)"
Setting  \fB$statistics\fR to 1 causes timing statistics to be
displayed upon the successful execution of  every  batch
of  \s-1SQL\s0.   This variable may also be set via the \fB\-t\fR command 
line flag, or by supplying \fB\-t\fR to the  \fB\ego\fR  command.
\&\fB$statistics\fR defaults to 0.
.IP "semicolon_cmd (string)" 4
.IX Item "semicolon_cmd (string)"
When  \fB$semicolon_hack\fR  (see below) is enabled, the contents 
of this variable is executed when a  semicolon  is
encountered  in  the \fB\s-1SQL\s0 Buffer\fR.  This variable defaults
to the string ‘\fB\ego\fR’.
.IP "semicolon_hack (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "semicolon_hack (boolean)"
Toggles on the ability to use a ‘;’ as an  in-line  command  
terminator. This feature is not recommended and is
only in here because enough users complained.  See  section 
\&\fB\s-1COMMANDS\s0, In-Line Go\fR.
.IP "\s-1SHELL\s0 (string)" 4
.IX Item "SHELL (string)"
The name of the shell to be used to execute pipes and to
be used by the \fB\eshell\fR command (default ‘/bin/sh’).
.IP "style (string)" 4
.IX Item "style (string)"
Selects result set display style. Currently  six  styles
are  supported.  The \fBhoriz\fR (which may also be defined as
\&\fBhor\fR or \fBhorizontal\fR),  closely  resembles  the  output  of
isql, with the traditional columnar output.
.Sp
The \fBvert\fR (or \fBvertical\fR) style rotates the output, so that
every line is represented by a column name followed by a
column  value.  This is nice for looking at particularly
wide output.
.Sp
The \fBbcp\fR style displays results in a format  amenable  to
bcp’ing  the  result  set back into another table.  That
is, every column value is separated by \fB$bcp_colsep\fR  with
the  final column separated by \fB$bcp_rowsep\fR followed by a
newline (\en). If  \fB$bcp_colsep\fR  or  \fB$bcp_rowsep\fR  are  not
defined  then ‘|’ is used as the default separator. Note
that  this  output  does  not  work  well  with  \s-1COMPUTE\s0
columns, and uses the default conversion methods for all
data types (that is, \fBdatetime\fR columns may  truncate  the
millisecond).
.Sp
The  \fBhtml\fR  display  style outputs all result sets in the
form of an \s-1HTML\s0 <\s-1TABLE\s0> construct.  This mode  is  ideal
for the use of sqsh as a \s-1CGI\s0 application.
.Sp
The \fBmeta\fR display style outputs only the meta-data information 
associated  with  the  result  and  discards  the
actual  row  results.  This mode is useful for debugging
the result sets generated  from  a  full  passthru  Open
Server  gateway,  or  for  those  interested  in what is
really coming back from the server.
.Sp
The \fBpretty\fR display style generates a  fluffy  table-like
output using regular \s-1ASCII\s0 characters for borders.  This
mode does not perform any explicit column wrapping, like
the \fBhoriz\fR display mode.  However, the \fB$colwidth\fR variable
can be used to control the maximum width of a given column  
on  the  screen.   If  the column exceeds \fB$colwidth\fR
characters wide, it is wrapped in a relatively  visually
appealing  manner.   Note that \fB$colwidth\fR may be exceeded
if there is enough screen  width  to  hold  the  columns
without wrapping.
.Sp
The \fBnone\fR display style suppresses all results from being
displayed (however  it  does  actually  retrieve  result
information  from the \s-1SQL\s0 Server).  This is particularly
useful when used with the \fB\-p\fR flag  (or  the  \fB$statistics\fR
variable) for gathering accurate performance statistics.
.IP "thresh_display (int)" 4
.IX Item "thresh_display (int)"
Sets the minimum \s-1SQL\s0 Server  error  severity  that  will
display  a  message  to  the  user, the default is 0 and
valid ranges are between 0 and 22, inclusive.
.IP "thresh_exit (int)" 4
.IX Item "thresh_exit (int)"
Defines the maximum number of errors of  severity  level
\&\fB$thresh_fail\fR  may  be  encountered  before  sqsh aborts.
This is useful primarily  for  non-interactive  scripts,
but  is  allowed  on  an  interactive  session.  Setting
\&\fB$thresh_exit\fR to a value of 0 disables this feature.  See
section \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR for details.
.IP "thresh_fail (int)" 4
.IX Item "thresh_fail (int)"
Sets the minimum \s-1SQL\s0 Server severity level that is to be
considered a failed batch.  The minimum for  this  value
is  0 (meaning any error that is not an information message), 
and the maximum is 22.  Whenever \fB$thresh_fail\fR  is
crossed, the variable \fB$batch_failcount\fR is incremented by
1.  See section \fB\s-1EXIT\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR for details.
.IP "time (date\-spec)" 4
.IX Item "time (date-spec)"
This variable may be set with a time format (see the man
page  for \fB\f(BIdate\fB\|(1)\fR), and the variable expands to the current 
time in the supplied format.   The  default  format
for this variable is \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S (e.g. 14:32:58).
.IP "tmp_dir (path)" 4
.IX Item "tmp_dir (path)"
This  contains  the  directory  to which temporary files
used internally by \fIsqsh\fR are to be written.  These  files
are   generated   either   during  buffer  editing  (the
\&\fB\ebuf\-edit\fR command), or to maintain  output  defer  files
for  background  jobs.  The default value for this variable is /tmp.
.IP "username (string)" 4
.IX Item "username (string)"
The  name  of  the  user  currently  connected  to   the
database.
.IP "version (none)" 4
.IX Item "version (none)"
This  read-only  variable  contains  the current version
number.
.IP "width (int)" 4
.IX Item "width (int)"
The current width of the \s-1SQL\s0 output.
.IP "xgeom (string/int)" 4
.IX Item "xgeom (string/int)"
If X11 support is compiled into \fIsqsh\fR, this value is used
to  configure the default window size (in characters) of
the X display.  This variable  must  be  of  the  format
\&\fBWxH\fR  or  just  \fBW\fR, where \fBW\fR is the width of the window
and \fBH\fR is the height of the window. If the height of the
window  is  not  supplied, then 25 lines is assumed.  If
\&\fB$xgeom\fR is not set, then \fB$width\fR is used  as  the  default
width and the height is assumed to be 25.  If neither is
set, then 80x25 is assumed.
.Sh "\s-1SCRIPT\s0 \s-1EXECUTION\s0"
.IX Subsection "SCRIPT EXECUTION"
As with most shells, \fIsqsh\fR allows a file containing \s-1SQL\s0 and script  commands 
to be executed directly via the magical \s-1UNIX\s0 \fB#!\fR convention.
On  most \s-1UNIX\s0 platforms, when the operating system encounters the bytes
\&\fB#!\fR as the first two bytes of an executable file it  will  automatically
pipe  the  file through the interpreter specified immediately after the
\&\fB#!\fR.  For example, to create an executable \fIsqsh\fR script  to  run  \fBsp_who\fR,
you simply need to create a file like so:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/sqsh -i
\&    sp_who
\&    go
.Ve
.PP
Thus, if your \fBsp_who\fR script is executed directly, it will automatically
launch "\fB/usr/local/bin/sqsh \-i sp_who\fR" for you.
.PP
And, to make things even more flexible, \fIsqsh\fR supports positional parameters,  
similar  to  most shells, of the form \fB${n}\fR which will expand to
the \fBn\fRth argument to your \fIsqsh\fR script.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/sqsh -i
\&    sp_who ${1}
\&    go
.Ve
.PP
will cause the \fBsp_who\fR stored procedure to be executed with an  argument
of  the  first  command  line  parameter  supplied  to the \fBsp_who\fR shell
script.
.PP
Note that positional parameters \fImust\fR be  contained  between  braces  to
avoid  conflicts with the \s-1TSQL\s0 \fBmoney\fR data type (without the braces, the
variable will not be expanded).
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
One of the major complaints of \fIisql\fR is that it provides no facility  to
detect when an error condition occurred while it is performing processing. 
\&\fIsqsh\fR provides  a  rather  complex,  but  flexible  mechanism  for
returning  meaningful information concerning its reason for exit in the
form of an exit status (see \fB\f(BIexit\fB\|(3)\fR).
.PP
When \fIsqsh\fR begins execution two handlers are associated with the current
connection to the database, one is a message handler which is responsible 
for displaying the text of any \s-1SQL\s0 Server messages or  errors,  and
the  other  is  an  error handler, which is responsible for determining
what to do with an error condition (bear with me, these are only  loose
descriptions). And, associated with each message and error condition is
a severity level, between 0 and 22 (informational message to fatal condition).
.PP
Associated  with  these two message handlers are several variables that
are used to either control their behavior, or are used as indicators by
the message handler:
.IP "$thresh_display" 4
.IX Item "$thresh_display"
This variable is used by the message handler to determine the minimum 
error severity which will cause a message to be displayed. By
default  this is 0, which will display all messages (with a couple
of exceptions).  Setting this to 1, for  example,  would  suppress
information messages such as the output of \fBset showplan\fR.
.IP "$thresh_fail" 4
.IX Item "$thresh_fail"
This  variable  is  used  by  the error handler to determine which
error severity is considered by \fIsqsh\fR to be  a  failure.  Normally,
this  defaults  to  11  which indicates that any error, other than
informational messages, is  a  failure.  The  next  variable  will
explain the importance of this value.
.IP "$batch_failcount" 4
.IX Item "$batch_failcount"
This  variable  should  be  considered read\-only, and contains the
total number of times that batches have caused an error of  severity 
\&\fB$thresh_fail\fR or more.  The only value that is valid to explicitly 
set this to is "" (the empty string), which will  reset  this
value to 0, any other value may have unpredictable results.
.IP "$thresh_exit" 4
.IX Item "$thresh_exit"
This variable is used to determine the limit at which \fB$batch_failcount\fR 
will cause \fIsqsh\fR to exit.  If \fB$thresh_exit\fR is  0,  then  this
feature  is  disabled.   In  other  words,  if \fB$batch_failcount = \f(CB$thresh_exit\fB\fR and 
\&\fB$thresh_exit\fR is greater than 0,  then  \fIsqsh\fR  will
exit, returning \fB$batch_failcount\fR as an exit status.
.Sp
Note that, unless \fB$exit_failcount\fR is set to 1, \fIsqsh\fR will exit with
0 if the total number of failures does not reach \fB$thresh_exit\fR.
.IP "$exit_failcount" 4
.IX Item "$exit_failcount"
This variable is used only when \fIsqsh\fR would normally  exit  with  a
success status (0), this causes it to instead exit with a value of
\&\fB$batch_failcount\fR (which may, itself, be 0).
.PP
To recap, here are a list of error codes that may be returned  by  \fIsqsh\fR
upon exit, and the reason that they could be returned:
.IP "0" 4
No error has been encountered.
.IP "1...253" 4
.IX Item "1...253"
Between  1  and 253 batches have failed (if you run more
than 253 batches, the exit status of  sqsh  is  undetermined...I may fix this in the future).
.IP "254" 4
.IX Item "254"
An  explicit  \fB\eabort\fR  was  called,  or a \s-1SIGINT\s0 (^C) was
issued during a non-interactive session.
.IP "255" 4
.IX Item "255"
A general error condition has occurred, such  as  a  bad command  line  argument to sqsh, 
memory allocation failure, file access error, etc.
.PP
The following sections provide detailed  examples  of  combinations  of
variable settings and the results produced upon exit with certain failure conditions:
.IP "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=1" 4
.IX Item "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=1"
With this combination, all error messages will  be  displayed  as  they
happen,  and every error will be considered an failure condition.  Upon
reaching the first error, \fIsqsh\fR will abort with an exit status of 1,  or
the total number of failures (the \fB$batch_failcount\fR variable).  However,
if nothing goes wrong during the whole process, a zero is returned.
.IP "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3" 4
.IX Item "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3"
This combination will cause all error conditions to  be  displayed  and
all  of them to be considered a failure condition.  Upon reaching three
total failed batches, \fIsqsh\fR with exit with a status of 3. However if  0,
1, or 2 batches fail, then 0 is returned.
.IP "thresh_display=22, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3" 4
.IX Item "thresh_display=22, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3"
This  behaves the same as the previous example, with the exception that
all error messages will be suppressed from being  displayed.   This  is
particularly useful if you just care about the exit value more than the
actual error.
.IP "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=2, thresh_exit=1" 4
.IX Item "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=2, thresh_exit=1"
This will cause the first error of severity 2 or higher to be displayed
and cause \fIsqsh\fR to exit with a failure condition of 1.
.IP "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3, exit_failcount=1" 4
.IX Item "thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3, exit_failcount=1"
This  is  identical  to  the  second  example, above, however \fBsqsh\fR will
return the total number of batches that failed even if \fB$batch_failcount\fR
does not reach 3.
.Sh "Miscellaneous"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous"
\fIColorizing sqsh prompts, etc.\fR
.IX Subsection "Colorizing sqsh prompts, etc."
.PP
Color codes are presented in a string between {1;2;3}. If sqsh encounters a {
(curly brace) in the prompt string it will assume a colorcode is supplied 
and will act as such. No checks will be performed on the validity of the colorcode
definition itself. The color definition consists of three values separated by
a semicolon.
.PP
The first code defines the Color Attribute Code with possible values: 0=none 1=bold
.PP
The second value defines the Text Color Code: 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
.PP
The third value defines the Background Color Code: 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
The last colorcode for the background may be ommitted.
.PP
Not all color and attribute combinations will present good results, depending
on your terminal type and color scheme. But the following values work right
for me on a xterm with a creamy white background color in Linux as well as
rxvt in Cygwin with a black background window:
.PP
Prompt: Blue text in white background \*(L"{0;34;47}\*(R"
.PP
Command text: Yellow text             \*(L"{0;33}\*(R"
.PP
sqsh will translate the colorcodes to an actual colorcode string that
is presented to readline: for example \*(L"\e001\e033[0;36;47m\e002\*(R"
Note that if you want to use curly brackets in your prompt, you have to
escape colorization by specifying a double brace, like {{...}}. For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   \eset prompt_color='{0;34;47}'
\&   \eset text_color='{0;33}'
\&   \eset prompt='$prompt_color{{$DSQUERY.$username.$database.$lineno}}>$text_color '
.Ve
.PP
Note, colorsupport is automatically available if sqsh is compiled and linked
with readline support enabled.

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
The  addition  of  flow-of-control  expressions  has  extended sqsh \fIway\fR
beyond the scope of its original design, and it is quite  obvious  from
using  the  features they are hacked in and are rather klunky (although
still quite usable).  As a result, the processing of these  expressions
is rather slow (when compared to bourne shell), and the error reporting
doesn’t lend itself to debugging large  scripts.   The  development  of
1000+ line scripts is discouraged.
.PP
The combination of backgrounding and pipes does not work properly right
now.  I know why this is happening, but haven’t determined  an  elegant
solution to it just yet.  What happens is, when a background job is run
that incorporates a pipe\-line, \fIsqsh\fR will suspend until the job is  complete, 
which is obviously not what you would desire.  To test this, try
the following:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    1> select * from syscolumns
\&    2> go | grep id &
.Ve
.PP
You will find that you do not get your prompt back until the  job  completes.   
If you want a technical explanation of why this is happening,
send me e\-mail at the address at the end.
.PP
I would like to support all of the flags available in \fIisql\fR  right  now.
This shouldn’t be very hard.
.PP
No complaints about spelling or grammar. I hate documentation, so count
yourself lucky that you have a manual page at all.
