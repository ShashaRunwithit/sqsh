Sqsh was written by Scott C. Gray. Scott did all the work through
release 2.1.

Sqsh is currently maintained by Michael Peppler (mpeppler@peppler.org) 
with the principal aim to keep sqsh's features and behavior in sync with
Sybase's capabilities as new features are added to ASE.

Release 2.1.6 includes a lot of code contributed by Martin Wesdorp 
(color prompts, better kerberos support, better timeout handling)
